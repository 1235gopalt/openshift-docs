Controller Role Verification

Module included in the following assemblies:

The {product-title} controller service,
`atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service`, is available across all master
hosts. The service runs in active/passive mode, meaning it should only be
running on one master at any time.

The {product-title} controllers execute a procedure to choose which host runs
the service. The current running value is stored in an annotation in a special
`configmap` stored in the `kube-system` project.

Verification of the master host actively running the
`atomic-openshift-master-controllers.service` service is performed by running
the following command as `cluster-admin`:

----
$ oc get -n kube-system cm openshift-master-controllers -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader: '{"holderIdentity":"master-ose-master-0.example.com-10.19.115.212-dnwrtcl4","leaseDurationSeconds":15,"acquireTime":"2018-02-17T18:16:54Z","renewTime":"2018-02-19T13:50:33Z","leaderTransitions":16}'
  creationTimestamp: 2018-02-02T10:30:04Z
  name: openshift-master-controllers
  namespace: kube-system
  resourceVersion: "17349662"

  uid: 08636843-0804-11e8-8580-fa163eb934f0
----

The command outputs the current master controller in the
`control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader` annotation, within the
`holderIdentity` property as:

----
master-<hostname>-<ip>-<8_random_characters>
----

In order to properly filter the hostname, the following command can be used:

----
$ oc get -n kube-system cm openshift-master-controllers -o json | jq -r .metadata.annotations[] | jq -r .holderIdentity | sed -e 's/^master-//g' -e 's/-[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}-.\{8\}$//g'
ose-master-0.example.com
