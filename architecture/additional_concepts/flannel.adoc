[[architecture-additional-concepts-flannel-overview]]
== Overview

*flannel* is a virtual networking layer designed specifically for containers. 
{product-title} can use it for networking containers instead of the default
software-defined networking (SDN) components.

== Architecture

Each host within the network runs an agent called *flanneld*, which is
responsibile for:

- Managing a unique subnet on each host
- Distributing IP addresses to each container on its host
- Mapping routes from one container to another, even if on different hosts

Each *flanneld* agent provides this infomation to a centralized *etcd* store so
other agents on hosts can create an overlay network and route packets to
any container within the *flannel* network.
