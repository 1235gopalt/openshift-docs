== Overview

*Contiv* is an open-source networking plugin module for container infrastructure. 
*Contiv* provides an infrastructure for application-oriented network policies and support for a range of multiple networking modes. These include a configurable set of overlay networking modes, physical networking modes and support for industry-leading hardware.  {product-title} can use it for networking containers instead of the default Openshift SDN. Full technical details on *contiv* are available at the 
link:http://contiv.github.io[Contiv github pages]

== Architecture

Each node within the cluster runs a *contiv* agent called *netplugin* while the master hosts run the *contiv* controller (referred to as *netmaster*) alongwith supporting control plane components (such as *etcd*). 

Together the components of *contiv (*netmaster* and *netplugin*) handle key networking functions for Openshift including 

- Assigning IP addresses to each container pod on each cluster node 
- Creating and managing multiple separate container network instances for different groups of containers 
- Configuring the network forwarding layer components for layer 2 or layer 3 forwarding
- Configuring and enforcing a range of network policies that provide  
- Providing management interfaces (including both CLI and GUI) to configure and manage contiv-specific features and configurations
- Providing an infrastructure for role based controls that allow for multiple role based network operations workflows. 

*Contiv* uses the Container Network Interface (link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/network-plugins/#cni[CNI]) to interface with Openshift/ Kubernetes. A key value store based on *etcd* is used to store contiv-specific state information. This is in addition to and separate from the instance of *etcd* used by other components in the system including Openshift itself.
