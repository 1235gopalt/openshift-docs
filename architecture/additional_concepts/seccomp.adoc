== Overview
Applications use seccomp to restrict the set of system calls they can make. OpenShift currently
has link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.4/docs/design/seccomp.md[alpha support for seccomp].
Support for seccomp allows administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in OpenShift.

Alpha support for seccomp is achieved via annotations on the pod.  There are two annotations that may be set
by the pod author or by the system's policy.

* seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod - profile applies to all containers in the pod that do not override
* container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/<container name> - container specific profile override

For detailed design information please refer to the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.4/docs/design/seccomp.md[upstream design document].

[NOTE]
====
Seccomp is a feature of the Linux kernel.  To ensure seccomp is enabled on your system you may run
```
$ cat /boot/config-`uname -r` | grep CONFIG_SECCOMP=
CONFIG_SECCOMP=y
```
====

[NOTE]
====
Currently containers are run with *unconfined* seccomp settings by default.

== Creating a profile

A seccomp profile is a json file providing syscalls and the appropriate action to take when a syscall is
invoked.  The link:https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json[default profile]
is sufficient in many cases but it is up to the cluster administrator to define the security constraints
of an individual system.

In order to create your own custom profile you must create a file on every node in the `seccomp-profile-root`
directory.

== Configuring OpenShift for seccomp

=== Kubelet

To begin using custom seccomp profiles you must first configure your nodes to use the *seccomp-profile-root* where
your profiles will be stored.  This is done in the *node-config.yaml* via the *kubeletArguments*.

```yaml
kubeletArguments:
  seccomp-profile-root:
    - "/your/path"
```

=== SCC

In order to control which profiles may be used and the default profile you may
xref:authorization.adoc#authorization-seccomp[configure your SCC] via the *seccompProfiles* field.  The first
profile will be used as a default.

When configuring seccomp profiles to use you must follow these formatting rules:

* runtime/default - the default profile for the container runtime (no profile on disk required)
* unconfined - unconfined profile, ie, no seccomp sandboxing
* localhost/<profile-name> - the profile installed to the node's local seccomp profile root

==== Examples

As an administrator I would like to require pods in my cluster to run with the *runtime/default* profile
in the *restricted* SCC.

* No need to setup the seccomp profile root since I will only be using the default profile
* Configure the *restricted* SCC with:

```yaml
seccompProfiles:
- runtime/default
```

As an administrator I would like to require pods in my cluster to run with a custom profile
in the *restricted* SCC.

* Create profile in *seccomp-profile-root*
* Configure *seccomp-profile-root* and restart nodes
* Configure the *restricted* SCC with:

```yaml
seccompProfiles:
- localhost/<profile-name>
```
