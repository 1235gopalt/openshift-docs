== Controlling What Can Be Deployed in a Container

If something happens during the build process, or if a vulnerability is
discovered after an image has been deployed, you can use tooling for automated,
policy-based deployment. You can use triggers to rebuild and replace images
instead of patching running containers, which is not recommended.

image::secure_deployments.png["Secure Deployments", align="center"]

For example, you build an application using three container image layers: core,
middleware, and applications. An issue is discovered in the core image and that
image is rebuilt. After the build is complete, the image is pushed to the
OpenShift Container Registry. {product-title} detects that the image has changed
and automatically rebuilds and deploys the application image, based on the
defined triggers. This change incorporates the fixed libraries and ensures that
the production code is identical to the most current image.

The `oc set triggers` command can be used to set a deployment trigger for a
deployment configuration. For example, to set an `ImageChangeTrigger` in a
deployment configuration called `frontend`:

----
$ oc set triggers dc/frontend \
    --from-image=myproject/origin-ruby-sample:latest \
    -c helloworld
----

[[security-deployment-secrets-configmaps]]
== Secrets and ConfigMaps

The `Secret` object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords, {product-title} client configuration files, *_dockercfg_* files,
and private source repository credentials. Secrets decouple sensitive content
from pods. You can mount secrets into containers using a volume plug-in or the
system can use secrets to perform actions on behalf of a pod.

For example, to add a secret to your deployment configuration using the web
console so that it can access a private image repository:

. Create a new project.

. Navigate to *Resources -> Secrets* and create a new secret. Set *Secret Type* to
*Image Secret* and *Authentication Type* to *Image Registry Credentials* to
enter credentials for accessing a private image repository.

. When creating a deployment configuration (for example, from the *Add to Project ->
Deploy Image* page), set the *Pull Secret* to your new secret.

`ConfigMaps` are similar to secrets, but are designed to support working with
strings that do not contain sensitive information. The `ConfigMap` object holds
key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or used to
store configuration data for system components such as controllers.

[[security-deployment-sccs]]
== Security Context Constraints (SCCs)

You can use _security context constraints_ (SCCs) to define a set of conditions
that a pod (a collection of containers) must run with in order to be accepted
into the system.

Some aspects that can be managed by SCCs include:

- Running of privileged containers.
- Capabilities a container can request to be added.
- Use of host directories as volumes.
- SELinux context of the container.
- Container user ID.

If you have the required permissions, you can adjust the default SCC policies to
be more permissive.

[[security-deployment-cd-tooling]]
== Continuous Deployment Tooling

You can integrate your own continuous deployment (CD) tooling with
{product-title}.

By leveraging CI/CD and {product-title}, you can automate the process of
rebuilding the application to incorporate the latest fixes, testing, and
ensuring that it is deployed everywhere within the environment.
