* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability.  The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod in order to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

====
While Kafka publisher is included in the release as part of Jaeger, it is not supported.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-4[MAISTRA-4] - The uninstall does not remove all the files, and as a result, when you re-install the istio-operator installation fails because `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "installations.istio.openshift.com"` already exists.

*Workaround* - In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following command:
```
oc process -f istio_product_operator_template.yaml | oc delete -f -
```

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-5[MAISTRA-5] - `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod tries to start but with errors.


https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-21[MAISTRA-21] - Increase elasticsearch memory requirement.
The current default in the installer is 512Mi however this appears to be too low for tracing.

*Workaround* - Include the following in the custom resource definition file.
```
spec:
  jaeger:
    elasticsearch_memory: 1Gi
```
