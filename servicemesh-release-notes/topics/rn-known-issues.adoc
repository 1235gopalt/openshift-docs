After eating an extra garlic pizza, Chris has bad breath and nobody wants to work closely with them.  As a workaround, Chris can take a breath mint, or avoid ordering extra garlic on their pizza.

These known issues or limitations exist in {ProductName} at this time:

* {ProductName} does not support multi-tenancy.

* {ProductName} does not support IPv6, as it it not supported by the upstream Istio project, nor fully supported by OpenShift.

* The istio-init container requires a privileged security context or at least to run as root and to have the NET_ADMIN capability.  The istio-init container needs to be privileged because it needs to properly configure the iptables rules in the pod in order to intercept network connections.  The team is currently investigating ideas for ways to reduce the privileges required by Istio.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-4[MAISTRA-4] - The uninstall does not remove all the files, and as a result, when you re-install the istio-operator installation fails because `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "installations.istio.openshift.com"` already exists.

*Workaround* - In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following command:
```
oc process -f istio_product_operator_template.yaml | oc delete -f -
```

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-5[MAISTRA-5] - `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod tries to start but with errors.

Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions).  Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts.  To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-13[MAISTRA-13] - Installer should determine release version from installed components.  At present, the installer queries the yaml file, however if the yaml has been modified, the installer is not able to remove an older version.

*Workaround* - If the installation fails because of a previous, older installation, then use the following workaround:

```
$ oc delete namespace devex istio-operator istio-system bookinfo logging foo bar

$ oc delete csr istio-sidecar-injector.istio-system

$ oc get crd  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crd

$ oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations

$ oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration

$ oc get clusterroles  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles

$ oc get clusterroles  | grep kiali | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles

$ oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings

$ oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep kiali | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings
```

https://github.com/kiali/kiali/issues/507[Kiali-507] Kiali does not support Internet Explorer 11.  This is because the underlying frameworks do not support Internet Explorer.  In order to access the Kiali console, use one of the two most recent versions of the Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari browser.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1284[KIALI-1284] In Istio, a Workload can be any pod or group of pods, regardless where they originate from. They may come from Kubernetes Deployments, Replica Sets or even as a single "orphan" pod. In Kiali the current assumption is that a Workload comes from a Deployment. This should represent the vast majority of the cases.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1570[KIALI-1570]
When a graph is loading in the Kiali console, a message that the graph is empty is displayed instead of a message that the graph is loading.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1572[KIALI-1572]
If you see this ERROR message when you view the Kiali logs, you can ignore it: `Failed to determine console version from file [/opt/kiali/console/version.txt]. error=open /opt/kiali/console/version.txt: no such file or directory Kiali: Console version: unknown`

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1609[KIALI-1609]
When dealing with very small values (for example, less than 0.0.1 rps) you might encounter some inconsistencies in the graph. We are working on making changes to have this function better when dealing with very small values.
