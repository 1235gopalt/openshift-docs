Provide the following info for each issue if possible:
Consequence - What user action or situation would make this problem appear  (If you have the foo option enabled and did x)? What did the customer experience as a result of the issue? What was the symptom?
Cause - Why did this happen?
Fix - What did we change to fix the problem?
Result - How has the behavior changed as a result?  Try to avoid “It is fixed” or “The issue is resolved” or “The error no longer presents”.

https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/pull/19/[MASITRA-21] -  The default in the installer of 512Mi was too low for tracing.  Increased default Elasticsearch memory from 512 MB to 1GB.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-4[MAISTRA-4] - The uninstall does not remove all the files, and as a result, when you re-install the istio-operator installation fails because `customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io "installations.istio.openshift.com"` already exists.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-5[MAISTRA-5] - `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod tries to start but with errors.
Graph layout - The layout for the Kiali graph can render differently, depending on your application architecture and the data to display (number of graph nodes and their interactions).  Because it is difficult if not impossible to create a single layout that renders nicely for every situation, Kiali offers a choice of several different layouts.  To choose a different layout, you can choose a different *Layout Schema* from the *Graph Settings* menu.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MAISTRA-13[MAISTRA-13] - Installer should determine release version from installed components.  At present, the installer queries the yaml file, however if the yaml has been modified, the installer is not able to remove an older version.

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KIALI-1572[KIALI-1572]
If you see this ERROR message when you view the Kiali logs, you can ignore it: `Failed to determine console version from file [/opt/kiali/console/version.txt]. error=open /opt/kiali/console/version.txt: no such file or directory Kiali: Console version: unknown`
