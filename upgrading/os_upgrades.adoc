Updating the operating system (OS) on a host, by either upgrading across major
releases or updating the system software for a minor release, can impact the
{product-title} software running on those machines. In particular, these updates
can affect the `iptables` rules or `ovs` flows that {product-title} requires to
operate.

== Updating the operating system on a host

To safely upgrade the OS on a host:

. Drain the node in preparation for maintenance:
+
----
$ oc adm drain <node_name> --force --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
----

. To protect sensitive packages that do not need to be updated,
apply the exclude rules to the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-docker-excluder exclude
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

. Update the host packages and reboot the host. A reboot ensures that the host is
running the newest versions and means that the `docker` and {product-title}
processes have been restarted, which forces them to check that all of the
rules in other services are correct.
+
----
# yum update
# reboot
----
+
However, instead of rebooting a node host, you can restart the services that are
affected or preserve the `iptables` state. Both processes are described in the
xref:../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#admin-guide-iptables[{product-title}
iptables] topic. The `ovs` flow rules do not need to be saved, but restarting
the {product-title} node software fixes the flow rules.

. Configure the host to be schedulable again:
+
----
$ oc adm uncordon <node_name>
----
