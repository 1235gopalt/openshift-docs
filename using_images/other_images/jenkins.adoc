== Overview
{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins.  This image provides a Jenkins server instance which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

This image also includes a sample Jenkins job which triggers a new build of a `*BuildConfig*` defined in {product-title}, tests the output of that build, and then on successful build, retags the output to indicate the build is ready for production.

[[versions]]
== Versions

{product-title} follows the https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] releases of Jenkins.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-1-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} Docker registry.
Additionally, you can create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the external location.
Your {product-title} resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example] ImageStream definitions for all the provided {product-title} images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing Jenkins

The first time you start Jenkins, the configuration is created along with the administrator user and password.
The default login is `*admin/password*`.
The default password can be configured by setting the `*JENKINS_PASSWORD*` environment variable.

The following command creates a new Jenkins xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pod] with Jenkins running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e \
    JENKINS_PASSWORD=<password> \
    openshift/jenkins-1-centos7
----

=== Environment Variables

The Jenkins password can be configured with the following environment variable:

.Jenkins Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*JENKINS_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*admin*` user.

|===


=== Volume Mount Points
The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* *_/var/lib/jenkins_* - This is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files including job definitions.

== Creating a Jenkins Service from a Template

xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[Templates] provide parameter fields to
define all the environment variables (password) with predefined defaults.
{product-title} provides templates to make creating a new Jenkins service easy. The
Jenkins templates should have been registered in the default *openshift* project
by your cluster administrator during the initial cluster setup.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
See xref:../../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#install-config-imagestreams-templates[Loading the Default Image Streams and Templates]
for more details, if required.
endif::[]

The two available templates both define a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration] and a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service],
but differ in their storage strategy, which affects whether or not the Jenkins
content persists across a pod restart.

[NOTE]
====
A pod may be restarted when it is moved to another node, or when an update of the deployment configuration triggers a redeployment.
====

* `jenkins-ephemeral` uses ephemeral storage. On pod restart, all data is lost.
This template is useful for development or testing only.

* `jenkins-persistent` uses a persistent volume store. Data survives a pod
restart. To use a persistent volume store, the cluster administrator must
define a persistent volume pool in the {product-title} deployment.

Once selected, you must xref:../../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[instantiate] the template to be able to use Jenkins.

[[jenkins-as-s2i-builder]]
== Using Jenkins as a Source-To-Image builder

To customize the official {product-title} Jenkins image, you have two options:

* Use Docker layering.
* Use the image as a Source-To-Image builder, described here.

You can use xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
to copy your custom Jenkins Jobs definitions, additional
plug-ins or replace the provided *_config.xml_* file with your own, custom, configuration.

In order to include your modifications in the Jenkins image, you need to have a Git
repository with the following directory structure:

*_plugins_*::
This directory contains those binary Jenkins plug-ins you want to copy into Jenkins.

*_plugins.txt_*::
This file lists the plug-ins you want to install:

----
pluginId:pluginVersion
----

*_configuration/jobs_*::
This directory contains the Jenkins job definitions.

*_configuration/config.xml_*::
This file contains your custom Jenkins configuration.

The contents of the *_configuration/_* directory will be copied
into the *_/var/lib/jenkins/_* directory, so you can also include
additional files, such as *_credentials.xml_*, there.

The following is an example build configuration that customizes the Jenkins
image in {product-title}:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: custom-jenkins-build
spec:
  source:                       <1>
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/custom/repository
    type: Git
  strategy:                     <2>
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: jenkins:latest
        namespace: openshift
    type: Source
  output:                       <3>
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: custom-jenkins:latest
----

<1> The `source` field defines the source Git repository
with the layout described above.
<2> The `strategy` field defines the original Jenkins image to use
as a source image for the build.
<3> The `output` field defines the resulting, customized Jenkins image
you can use in deployment configuration instead of the official Jenkins image.

[[using-the-jenkins-kubernetes-plug-in-to-run-jobs]]
== Using the Jenkins Kubernetes Plug-in to Run Jobs

The official {product-title} Jenkins image includes the pre-installed
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes
plug-in] that allows Jenkins slaves to be dynamically provisioned on multiple
container hosts using Kubernetes and {product-title}.

To use the Kubernetes plug-in, {product-title} provides three images
suitable for use as Jenkins slaves: the *_Base_*, *_Maven_*, and *_NodeJS_* images.

The first is a https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-base[base image] for Jenkins slaves:

 - It pulls in both the required tools (headless Java, the Jenkins JNLP client) and the useful ones
(including git, tar, zip, nss among others). 
 - It establishes the JNLP slave agent as the entrypoint.
 - It includes the oc client tooling for invoking command line operations from within Jenkins jobs, and
 - It provides Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL images.

Two additional images, that extends the base image are also provided, namely:

* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-maven[Maven], and
* https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/slave-nodejs[NodeJS]

Both the Maven and NodeJS slave images are configured as Kubernetes Pod Tempate images within the {product-title} Jenkins image's
configuration for the Kubernetes plugin.  That configuration includes labels for each of the images that can
be applied to any of your Jenkins jobs under their "Restrict where this project can be run" setting. If the label is applied,
execution of the given job will be done under an {product-title} Pod running the respective slave image.

The Maven and NodeJS Jenkins slave images provide Dockerfiles for both Centos and RHEL that you can reference when building new slave images.
Also note the `contrib` and `contrib/bin` subdirectories.  They allow for the insertion of configuration files and executable
scripts for your image.

The Jenkins image also provides auto-discovery and auto-configuration
of slave images for the 
Kubernetes plug-in. The Jenkins image searches for these in the existing image streams within the project that it is running in. The search specifically looks for image streams that have the label `role` set to `jenkins-slave`.

When it finds an image stream with this label, it generates the corresponding Kubernetes plug-in 
configuration so you can assign your Jenkins
jobs to run in a pod running the container image provided by the image stream.

[NOTE]
====
This scanning is only performed once, when the Jenkins master is starting.
Please restart the Jenkins master if you label additional image streams(to pickup the added labels).
====

To use a container image as an Jenkins slave, the image must run the slave agent as
an entrypoint. For more details about this, refer to the official
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-Launchslaveagentheadlessly[Jenkins
documentation].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== OpenShift Pipeline Plug-in

The Jenkins image's list of pre-installed plug-ins includes a plug-in which assists in the creating of CI/CD workflows that run against
an {product-title} server.  A series of build steps, post-build actions, as well as SCM-style polling are provided which equate to administrative
and operational actions on the {product-title} server and the API artifacts hosted there.

In addition to being accessible from the classic "freestyle" form of Jenkins
job, the build steps as of version 1.0.14 of the {product-title} Pipeline
Plug-in are also avaible to Jenkins Pipeline jobs via the DSL extension points
provided by the Jenkins Pipeline Plug-in. The https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/jenkins/pipeline/samplepipeline.json[OpenShift Jenkins Pipeline build strategy sample]
illustrates how to use the OpenShift Pipeline plugin DSL versions of its steps.

The https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/tree/master/1/contrib/openshift/configuration/jobs/OpenShift%20Sample[sample Jenkins job] that is pre-configured in the Jenkins image utilizes the OpenShift pipeline plug-in and serves as an example of
how to leverage the plug-in for creating CI/CD flows for {product-title} in Jenkins.

See the https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-plugin/[the plug-in's README] for a detailed description of what is available.
