You can use arbitrary container images in your {product-title} instance, for
example those found on the https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
For instructions on how to enable images to run with *USER* in the Dockerfile,
see xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#how-do-i[Managing Security Context
Constraints].

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} runs containers using an arbitrarily assigned user ID. This
behavior provides additional security against processes escaping the container
due to a container engine vulnerability and thereby achieving escalated
permissions on the host node. Due to this restriction, images that run as root
will not deploy as expected on {product-title}.
