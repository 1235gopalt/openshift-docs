[[benefits-of-using-dot-net-core]]
== Benefits of Using .NET Core

link:http://developers.redhat.com/dotnet/[.NET Core] is a general purpose
development platform featuring automatic memory management and modern
programming languages. It allows users to build high quality applications
efficiently. .NET Core is available on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7) and
{product-title} via certified containers. .NET Core offers:

* The ability to follow a microservices-based approach, where some components are
built with .NET and others with Java, but all can run on a common, supported
platform in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and {product-title}.
* The capacity to more easily develop new .NET Core workloads on Windows;
customers are able to deploy and run on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux or
Windows Server.
* A heterogeneous data center, where the underlying infrastructure is capable of
running .NET applications without having to rely solely on Windows Server.
* Access to many of the popular development frameworks such as .NET, Java, Ruby,
and Python from within {product-title}.

[[dot-net-core-supported-versions]]
== Supported Versions

* .NET Core version 1.0
** Supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 {product-title} versions 3.3 and later

[[dot-net-core-installing-images]]
== Images

Image stream definitions for the .NET Core on RHEL S2I image are now added
during {product-title} installations.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

The RHEL 7 images are available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/dotnet/dotnetcore-10-rhel7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-image-registry[image
registries], or push them into your
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[{product-title}
Docker registry]. Additionally, you can create an
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[image stream definition].

[[dot-net-core-configuration]]
== Configuration

The .NET Core images support a number of environment variables, which you can
set to control the build behavior of your .NET Core application.

[NOTE]
====
You must set environment variables that control build behavior in the S2I build
configuration or in the *_.s2i/environment_* file in order to make them
available to the build steps.
====

.NET Core Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable Name |Description |Default

|`DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT`
|Used to select the project to run. This must be the folder in the source repository containing *_project.json_*.
|*_._*

|`DOTNET_PUBLISH`
|Used to control whether the application should be built by executing `dotnet
build` or `dotnet publish`. To publish the application, set the value to `true`.
It is recommended to publish your application.
|For backwards compatibility, the
default is `false`.

In the next major release, this variable will be removed and the builder will
always publish the application.

|`DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME`
|Used to select the assembly to run. This must _not_ include the `.dll`
extension. Set this to the output assembly name specified in *_project.json_*
(`name`, `buildOptions/outputName`). For *_project.json_*, the assembly name
defaults to the *_project.json_* parent folder. When *_project.json_* is at the
*_context-dir_*, the parent folder name will be *_src_*. So, by default, this
generates a `src.dll` assembly. Setting `DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME` will cause:

  - The assembly to be `<DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME>.dll`
  - The application sources to be in subfolder `DOTNET_ASSEMBLY_NAME` in the deployed container.

|The name of the `DOTNET_STARTUP_PROJECT` folder.

|`DOTNET_RESTORE_SOURCES`
|Used to specify the space-separated list of *NuGet* package sources used during
the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the
*_NuGet.config_* file.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_NPM_TOOLS`
|Used to specify a list of NPM packages to install before building the application.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_TEST_PROJECTS`
|Used to specify the space-separated list of test projects to run. This must be folders containing
 *_project.json_*. `dotnet test` is invoked for each folder.
|Unset

|`DOTNET_CONFIGURATION`
|Used to run the application in `Debug` or `Release` mode. This value should be
either `Release` or `Debug`.
|`Release`

|`ASPNETCORE_URLS`
|This variable is set to `\http://*:8080` to configure ASP.NET Core to use the
 port exposed by the image. It is _not_ recommended to change this.
|`\http://*:8080`

== Quickly Deploying Applications from .NET Core Source

[IMPORTANT]
====
The
link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore/blob/master/dotnet_imagestreams.json[.NET
image stream] must first be installed. If you ran a standard installation, the
image stream will be present.
====

An image can be used to build an application by running `oc new-app` against a
sample repository:

----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore --context-dir=1.0/test/asp-net-hello-world
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The `oc new-app` command can detect .NET Core source starting in {product-title} 3.3.
