For {gluster-native}, the {product-title} Advanced Installer comes with a
playbook to uninstall all resources and artifacts from the cluster. To use it,
provide the original inventory file that was used to install the target instance
of {gluster-native} and run the following playbook:

----
ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml
----

In addition, the playbook supports the use of a variable called
`openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe` which, when enabled, will destroy any data on
the block devices that were used for {gluster} backend storage. It is recommend
to use this variable like so:

----
ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> -e "openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe=true" /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml
----

[WARNING]
====
This procedure will destroy data. Proceed with caution.
