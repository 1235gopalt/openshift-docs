Red Hat has announced the
link:https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[Operator Framework],
an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications, called
_Operators_, in a more effective, automated, and scalable way.

The following sections provide instructions for trying out the Technology
Preview Operator Framework in {product-title} 3.11 as a cluster administrator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operator Framework is a Technology Preview feature.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

== What's in the Technology Preview?

The Technology Preview Operator Framework installs the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)],
which aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access
to Operators running on their {product-title} cluster.

The {product-title} web console is also updated with new management screens for
cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects
access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring
instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be
subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.

.Operator Catalog Sources

In the screenshot, you can see the pre-loaded catalog sources of partner
Operators from leading software vendors:

MongoDB:: Run three different flavors of this popular database for clustered and stand alone usage in conjunction with the OpsManager.

Dynatrace:: Easily install this container-focused monitoring stack and connect it back to the Dynatrace monitoring cloud.

Couchbase:: Install and seamlessly failover your NoSQL clusters.
