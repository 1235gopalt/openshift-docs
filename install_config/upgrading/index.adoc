When new versions of OpenShift are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.1 to
3.2, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.2.z
releases). See the link:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.html[OpenShift
Enterprise 3.2 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the link:../../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.html[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3 and require a fresh installation.
====
endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick] or
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
and the *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was
used is available,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Starting with Origin 1.0.6, if you installed using the
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] and the
inventory file that was used is available,
endif::[]
you can perform an
link:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html[automated upgrade].
Alternatively, you can
link:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.html[upgrade OpenShift
manually].

[NOTE]
====
The Upgrading topics pertains to RPM-based installations only
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
(i.e., the link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick] and
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
methods)
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
(i.e., the link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced
installation] method)
endif::[]
 and does not currently cover container-based installations.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Upgrades from {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 are currently only supported for
clusters using the RPM-based installation method. Administrators with clusters
using the
link:../../install_config/install/rpm_vs_containerized.html[containerized
installation method] should not perform an upgrade at this time, as development
for this upgrade path is currently in progress. Performing a containerized
upgrade at this time would be detrimental to your cluster. An asynchronous
errata update will be released shortly to provide the ability to successfully
upgrade containerized installations.
