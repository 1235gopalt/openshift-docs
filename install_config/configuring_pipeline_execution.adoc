== Overview

{product-title} utilizes Jenkins to execute continuous development pipelines.  To
provide a seamless experience for users, the first time a user creates a build
configuration using the xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[pipeline]
strategy type, a set of Jenkins related resources will be created within the user's project.
By default, the system will look for a template named `*jenkins*` in the `*openshift*` namespace and
instantiate it within the user's project.  {product-title} ships with a default template definition
which will, upon instantiation, create the following in the user's project:

* a deployment configuration for Jenkins using the official {product-title} Jenkins image
* a service and route for accessing the Jenkins deployment
* a new Jenkins service account and rolebindings to grant the service account edit access to the user's project

Cluster administrators can control what is created for users by either modifying the content of the template
registered in the `*openshift*` namespace under the `*jenkins*` name, or by editing the cluster configuration
to direct the cluster to a different template location.

----
<1> Defaults to true.  If set to false then no template will be instantiated with pipeline build configurations are defined.
<2> Namespace containing the template to be instantiated when a pipeline build configuration is defined.
<3> Name of the template to be instantiated when a pipeline build configuration is defined.
<4> Name of the service that must be created by the template upon instantiation.
<5> Optional template parameters values to pass to the template during the instantiation process.
====

The template instantiation logic operates by checking if a service matching the `*serviceName*` value exists in the
user's project when a new pipeline build configuration is being created.  If it does not, the configured template
is intantiated.  This means `*serviceName*` must be chosen such that it does not conflict with any service names a user
may already have in their project as this will result in the template not being instantiated when needed.

If the user deletes the build configuration, the Jenkins resources will remain unless the user explicitly removes them.
If additional pipeline build configurations are created, the existing Jenkins resources will be used for all pipeline
build configurations within a single project.
