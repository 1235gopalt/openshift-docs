== Overview

Frequently, portions of a datacenter may not have access to the Internet, even
via proxy servers. Installing OpenShift in these environments is considered a
disconnected installation.

An OpenShift Enterprise disconnected installation differs from a regular
installation in two primary ways:

* The OpenShift software channels and repositories are not available via Red Hat’s content distribution network. 
* OpenShift uses several Dockerized components. Normally, these images are pulled
directly from Red Hat’s Docker registry. In a disconnected environment, this is
not possible.

A disconnected installation ensures the OpenShift software is made available to
the relevant servers, then follows the same installation process as a standard
connected installation. This topic additionally details how to manually download
the Docker images and transport them onto the relevant servers. 

Once installed, in order to use OpenShift, you will need source code in a source
control repository (for example, Git). This topic assumes that an internal Git
repository is available that can host source code and this repository is
accessible from the OpenShift nodes. Installing the source control repository is
outside the scope of this document.

Also, when you try building applications in OpenShift, your build may have some
external dependencies, such as a Maven Repository or Gem files for Ruby
applications. By default, Red Hat docker images try to reach out to external
repositories on the Internet. You can configure OpenShift to use your own
internal repositories. For the purposes of this document, we assume that such
internal repositories already exist and are accessible from the OpenShift nodes
hosts. Installing such repositories is outside the scope of this document.
 
[NOTE]
====
You can also have a
http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/satellite[Satellite]
server that provides access to Red Hat content via the intranet/LAN. For
environments with Satellite, you can synchronize the OpenShift software onto
Satellite for use with the OpenShift servers. 

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-satellite/[Satellite 6.1]
also introduces the ability to act as a Docker registry, and it can be used to
host the OpenShift Dockerized components. Doing so is outside of the scope of
this document.
====

[[disconnected-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you understand
link:../../architecture/index.adoc[OpenShift's overall architecture] and that
you have already planned out what the topology of your environment will look
like.

[[disconnected-required-software-and-components]]
== Required Software and Components

In order to pull down the required software repositories and Docker images, you
will need a RHEL7 server with access to the Internet and at least 100GB of
additional free space. All steps in this section should be performed on the
internet-connected server as the root system user.

[[disconnected-syncing-repos]]
=== Syncing Repositories

[NOTE]
====
Before you sync with the required repositories, you may need to import the
appropriate GPG key:
+
----
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
----
+
If the key is not imported, the indicated package is deleted after syncing the repository. 
====

. Register the server with Red Hat’s customer portal. You will need to use
the login and password associated with the account that has access to the
OpenShift subscriptions.
+
----
# subscription-manager register
----

. Attach to a subscription that provides OpenShift channels. You can find the
list of available subscriptions using: 
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----
+
Then, find the pool ID for the subscription that provides OpenShift, and attach
it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=${pool_id}
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----

. The `yum-utils` command provides the *reposync* utility, which lets you mirror
yum repositories, and `createrepo` can create a usable yum repository from a
directory.
+
----
# yum -y install yum-utils createrepo docker git
----
+
You will need up to 110GB of free space in order to sync the software.
Depending on how restrictive your organization’s policies are, you could
re-connect this server to the disconnected LAN and use it as the repository
server. You could use USB-connected storage and transport the software to
another server that will act as the repository server. This topic covers these
options.

. Make a path to where you want to sync the software (either locally or on your
USB or other device):
+
----
# mkdir -p /path/to/repos
----

. Sync the packages and create the repo for each of them. You will need
to modify the command for the appropriate path you created above:
+
----
# for repo in \
rhel-7-server-rpms rhel-7-server-extras-rpms \
rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
do
  reposync --gpgcheck -lm --repoid=${repo} --download_path=/path/to/repos
  createrepo -v /path/to/repos/${repo}
done
----

[[disconnected-syncing-images]]
=== Syncing Images

. Start the Docker daemon:
+
----
# systemctl start docker
----

. Pull all of the required OpenShift dockerized components:
+
----
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-deployer:v3.1.0.4

# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-pod:v3.1.0.4
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.0.4
----

. Pull all of the required OpenShift Dockerized components for the additional centralized log aggregation and metrics aggregation components:

----
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployment
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana

# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-hawkular-metrics
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-cassandra
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-heapster
----

. Pull Red Hat’s certified Source-to-Image (S2I) builder images.
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#source-build[S2I]
is the process that OpenShift uses to take application code and build it into a
Docker image to run on the platform.

Any languages, runtimes, or databases that you do not intend to use,
can be skipped.

[[disconnected-prepare-images-for-export]]
=== Prepare Images for Export

Docker images can be exported from a system by first saving them to a tarball
and then transporting them. 

. Make and change into a repository home directory:
+
----
# mkdir /path/to/repos/images
# cd /path/to/repos/images
----

. Export the OpenShift Dockerized components:
+
----
# docker save -o ose3-images.tar \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-deployer \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-sti-builder \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-builder \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-pod \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry 
----

. If you synchronized the metrics and log aggregation images, export:
+
----
# docker save -o ose3-logging-metrics-images.tar \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-deployment \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd \

    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-deployer \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-hawkular-metrics \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-cassandra \
    registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/metrics-heapster
----

. Export the S2I builder images, making sure to remove any items that you did
not sync in the previous section:
+
----
# docker save -o ose3-builder-images.tar \
    registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift \
    registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift \

---- 

[[disconnected-repo-server]]
== Repository Server

During the installation (and for later updates, should you so choose) you will
need a webserver to host the repositories. RHEL7 can provide the Apache
webserver.

*Option 1*: Re-configure as a Web server

If you can re-connect the server where you synchronized the software and images
to your LAN, then you can simply install Apache on the server:

----
# yum install httpd
----

Skip to link:#disconnected-placing-the-software[Placing the Software].

*Option 2*: Building a Repository Server

If you need to build a separate server to act as the repository server, install
a new RHEL7 system with at least 110GB of space. On this repository server
during the installation make sure you select the *Basic Web Server* option.

[[disconnected-placing-the-software]]
=== Placing the Software

. If necessary, attach the external storage, and then copy the repository
files into Apache’s root folder. Note that the below copy step (`cp -a`) should
be substituted with move (`mv`) if you are repurposing the server you used to
sync.
+
----
# cp -a /path/to/repos /var/www/html/
# chmod -R +r /var/www/html/repos
# restorecon -vR /var/www/html
----

. Add the firewall rules:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --permanent  --add-service=http
# firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Enable and start Apache for the changes to take effect:
+
----
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd
----

[[disconnected-openshift-systems]]
== OpenShift Systems

[[disconnected-build-your-hosts]]
=== Build Your Hosts

At this point you can perform the initial creation of the hosts that will be
part of the OpenShift environment. It is recommended to use the latest version
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and to perform a minimal installation. You will also
want to pay attention to the other
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc[OpenShift-specific
prerequisites].

Once the hosts are initially built, the repositories can be set up.

[[disconnected-connecting-repos]]
=== Connecting The Repositories

On all of the relevant systems that will need OpenShift software components,
create the required repository definitions. Place the following text in the
*_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* file, replacing `<server_IP>` with the IP or
hostname of the Apache server hosting the software repositories:

====
----
[rhel-7-server-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-rpms
baseurl=http://<server_IP>/repos/rhel-7-server-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[rhel-7-server-extras-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
baseurl=http://<server_IP>/repos/rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
[rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms]
name=rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
baseurl=http://<server_IP>/repos/rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
----
====

[[disconnected-host-preparations]]
=== Host Preparation

At this point, the systems are ready to continue to be prepared
link:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#host-preparation[following
the OpenShift documentation].

Skip the section titled *Registering the Hosts* and start with *Managing
Packages*.

[[disconnected-openshift-installation]]
== OpenShift Installation

[[disconnected-import-openshift-dockerized-components]]
=== Import OpenShift Dockerized Components

To import the relevant components, securely copy the images from the connected
host to the individual OpenShift hosts:

----
# scp /var/www/html/repos/images/ose3-images.tar root@openshift.host.name:
# ssh root@openshift.host.name "docker load -i ose3-images.tar"
----

If you prefer, you could use `wget` on each OpenShift host to fetch the tar
file, and then perform the Docker import command locally. Perform the same steps
for the metrics and logging images, if you synchronized them.

On the host that will act as an OpenShift Master, copy and import the builder
images:

----
# scp /var/www/html/images/ose3-builder-images.tar root@openshift.masterhost.name: 
# ssh root@openshift.masterhost.name "docker load -i ose3-builder-images.tar"
----

[[disconnected-run-the-openshift-installer]]
=== Run the OpenShift Installer

You can now choose to follow the
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc[quick] or
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc[advanced] OpenShift
installation instructions in the documentation. 

[[disconnected-create-the-internal-docker-registry]]
=== Create the Internal Docker Registry

You now need to link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc[create
the internal Docker registry].

[[disconnected-post-installation-changes]]
== Post-Installation Changes

In one of the previous steps, the S2I images were imported into the Docker
daemon running on one of the OpenShift Master hosts. In a connected
installation these images would be pulled from Red Hat’s registry on demand.
Since the Internet is not available to do this, the images must be made
available in another Docker registry.

OpenShift provides an internal registry for storing the images that are built
as a result of the S2I process, but it can also be used to hold the S2I builder
images. The following steps assume you did not customize the service IP subnet
(172.30.0.0/16) or the Docker registry port (5000).

[[disconnected-re-tag-s2i-builder-images]]
=== Re-tag S2I Builder Images

. On the Master host where you imported the S2I builder images, obtain the
service address of your docker registry that you installed on the master:
+
----
# export REGISTRY=$(oc get service docker-registry -t '{{.spec.clusterIP}}{{"\n"}}')
----

. Next, tag all of the builder images before pushing them into the OpenShift Docker registry:
+
----
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-amq-6/amq-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/amq-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-6/eap-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/eap-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat7-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat7-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-webserver-3/tomcat8-openshift $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat8-openshift
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mysql-56-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mysql-56-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/perl-520-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/perl-520-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/php-56-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/php-56-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/postgresql-94-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/postgresql-94-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-27-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-27-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-34-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-34-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/ruby-22-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/ruby-22-rhel7
# docker tag registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/nodejs-010-rhel7 $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7 
----

[[disconnected-create-an-admin-user]]
=== Create an Administrative User

Pushing the Docker images into OpenShift’s Docker registry requires a user with
administrator privileges. Because the default OpenShift system administrator
does not have a standard authorization token, they cannot be used to log in to
the Docker registry.

Create a new user account in the authentication system you are using with
OpenShift. For example, if you are using local htpasswd-based authentication:

----
# htpasswd -b /etc/openshift/openshift-passwd <username> <password>
----

The external authentication system now has a user account, but a user must log
in to OpenShift before an account is created in the internal database. Log in to
OpenShift for this account to be created. This assumes you are using the
self-signed certificates generated by OpenShift during the installation:

----
# oc login --certificate-authority=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    -u adminuser https://openshift.master.host:8443
----

Get the user’s authentication token:

----
# MYTOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
# echo $MYTOKEN
iwo7hc4XilD2KOLL4V1O55ExH2VlPmLD-W2-JOd6Fko
----

[[disconnected-modify-the-securitry-policies]]
=== Modify the Security Policies

. Using `oc login` switches to the new user. Switch back to the OpenShift system
administrator in order to make policy changes:
+
----
# oc login -u system:admin
----

. In order to push images into the OpenShift Docker registry, an account must
have the `image-builder` security role. Add this to your OpenShift admin user:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <admin_username>
----

. Next, add the administrative role to the user in the openshift project. This
allows the admin user to edit the openshift project, and, in this
case, push the Docker images:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <admin_username> -n openshift
----

[[disconnected-edit-the-imagestream-definitions]]
=== Edit the Imagestream Definitions

The `openshift` project is where all of the imagestreams for builder images are
created by the installer. They are loaded by the installer from the
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_* directory. Change all of the
definitions by deleting the imagestreams which had been loaded into OpenShift’s
database, then re-create them.

. Delete the existing imagestreams:
+
----
# oc delete is -n openshift --all
----

. Make a backup of the files in *_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_* if you
desire. Next, edit the file *_image-streams-rhel7.json_* in the
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams_* folder. You will find an
imagestream section for each of the builder images. Edit the `spec` stanza to
point to your internal docker registry. For example:
+
====
----
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/mongodb-26-rhel7",
----
====
+
changes to
+
====
----
"spec": {
  "dockerImageRepository": "172.30.69.44:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7",
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The repository name (`rhscl`) was changed to `openshift`. You will need to
ensure the change, regardless of whether the repository is `rhscl`,
`openshift3`, or another directory. Every definition should have the following
format:

----
<REGISTRY_IP>:5000/openshift/<IMAGENAME>
----
====
+
Repeat this change for every imagestream in the file. Ensure you use the correct
IP address that you determined earlier. When you are finished, save and exit.
Repeat the same process for the JBoss imagestreams in
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json_*.

. Load the updated imagestream definitions:
+
----
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json -n openshift
# oc create -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/xpaas-streams/jboss-image-streams.json -n openshift
----

[[disconnected-load-the-docker-images]]
=== Load the Docker Images

At this point the system is ready to load the Docker images.

. Log in to the Docker registry using the token and registry service IP
obtained earlier:
+
----
# docker login -u adminuser -e mailto:adminuser@abc.com \
   -p $MYTOKEN $REGISTRY:5000
----

. Push the Docker images:
+
----
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/amq-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/eap-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat7-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/tomcat8-openshift
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mongodb-26-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/mysql-56-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/perl-520-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/php-56-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/postgresql-94-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/python-27-rhel7

# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/ruby-22-rhel7
# docker push $REGISTRY:5000/openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7 
----

. Verify the that all the imagestreams now have the tags populated:
+
====
----
# oc get imagestreams -n openshift

[[disconnected-install-a-router]]
== Install a Router

At this point the OpenShift environment is almost ready for use. It is likely
that you will want to link:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.html [install and configure a router].
