== Overview

An external provisioner is an application that enables dynamic provisioning for
a particular storage provider. External provisioners can run alongside the
provisioner plug-ins provided by {product-title} and are configured in a
similar way using xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc[_StorageClasses_]. However, being external, they can be deployed
and updated independently of {product-title} on an as-needed basis.

[[provisioners-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

An Ansible playbook is available to deploy and upgrade external provisioners. You
should familiarize yourself with the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installation]
section. This provides information for preparing to use Ansible and includes
information about configuration. Parameters are added to the Ansible inventory
file to configure which external provisioners to install and various areas of
them.

[[provisioners-ansible-role]]
== External Provisioners Ansible Role

The OpenShift Ansible `openshift_provisioners` role configures and deploys
external provisioners using the variables from the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring Ansible]
inventory file. You must specify which provisioners to install by overriding
their respective "install" variables to `true`.

[[provisioners-ansible-variables]]
=== External Provisioners Ansible Variables

The following is a list of role variables that apply to all provisioners for
which the "install" variable is `true`.

.Ansible Variables
[options="header"]

|`openshift_provisioners_install_provisioners`
|Deploy provisioners that have their respective "install" variables `true`, if
`true`. Otherwise, undeploy them.

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
`openshift3/openshift-efs-provisioner:3.6.0`, set version as `3.6.0`.
endif::[]

[[provisioners-efs-ansible-variables]]
=== AWS EFS Provisioner Ansible Variables

The AWS EFS provisioner dynamically provisions
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc[NFS PVs]
backed by dynamically created directories in a given EFS file system's
directory. The following prequisites must be met before required variables can
be configured:

- An IAM user assigned the AmazonElasticFileSystemReadOnlyAccess policy (or better)
- An EFS file system in your cluster's region
- link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs.html[Mount targets] and link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs-create-security-groups.html[security groups] such that any node (in any zone in the cluster's region) can mount the EFS file system by its link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/mounting-fs-mount-cmd-dns-name.html[File system DNS name]

.Required EFS Ansible Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Description

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_fsid`
|The link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-two-create-efs-resources.html[File system ID] of the EFS file system, e.g. fs-47a2c22e

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_region`
|The Amazon EC2 region of the EFS file system.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_aws_access_key_id`
|The AWS access key of the IAM user, used to check that the EFS file system specified actually exists.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_aws_secret_access_key`
|The AWS secret access key of the IAM user, used to check that the EFS file system specified actually exists.

|===

.Optional EFS Ansible Variables
[options="header"]
|===

|Variable |Description

|`openshift_provisioners_efs`
| When `True` the AWS EFS provisioner will be installed or uninstalled according to whether `openshift_provisioners_install_provisioners` is `True` or `False`, respectively. Defaults to `False`.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_path`
| The path of the directory in the EFS file system in which the EFS provisioner will create a directory to back each PV it creates. It must exist and be mountable by the EFS provisioner. Defaults to '/persistentvolumes'.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_name`
| The `provisioner` name that _StorageClasses_ specify. Defaults to 'openshift.org/aws-efs'.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_nodeselector`
| A map of labels (e.g. {"node":"infra","region":"west"} to select the nodes where the pod will land.

|`openshift_provisioners_efs_supplementalgroup`
| The supplemental group to give the pod in case it is needed for permission to write to the EFS file system. Defaults to '65534'.

[[deploying-the-provisioners]]
== Deploying the Provisioners

You can deploy all provisioners at once or one at a time according to how you
configure your OpenShift Ansible variables.

The following examples show you how to deploy a given provisioner and then
create and configure a corresponding xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc[_StorageClass_].

[[deploying-the-aws-efs-provisioner]]
=== Deploying the AWS EFS Provisioner
The following command sets the directory in the EFS volume to use to
"/data/persistentvolumes", which must exist in the file system and be mountable
and writeable by the provisioner pod.

----
$ ansible-playbook <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/common/openshift-cluster/openshift_provisioners.yml \
   -e openshift_provisioners_install_provisioners=True \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs=True \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs_fsid=fs-47a2c22e \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs_region=us-west-2 \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs_aws_access_key_id=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs_aws_secret_access_key=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY \
   -e openshift_provisioners_efs_path=/data/persistentvolumes

[[nfs-selinux]]
==== SELinux
For information on how to allow the provisioner pod to write to EFS directory, which is a remote NFS directory, see the xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#nfs-supplemental-groups[SELinux] section of NFS Volume Security. The same information applies for allowing other pods to consume the NFS volumes provisioned by the provisioner pod.

[[aws-efs]]
==== AWS EFS Object Definition

.aws-efs-storageclass.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: openshift.org/aws-efs <1>
parameters:
  gidMin: "40000" <2>
  gidMax: "50000" <3>
----

<1> Set this according to what the `openshift_provisioners_efs_name` variable is set to, which defaults to "openshift.org/aws-efs"
<2> Optional. The minimum value of GID range for the storage class.
<3> Optional. The maximum value of GID range for the storage class.

Each dynamically provisioned volume's corresponding NFS directory will be assigned a unique GID owner from the range `gidMin`-`gidMax`. If not specified, `gidMin` defaults to 2000 and `gidMax` to 2147483647. Any pod that consumes a provisioned volume via a claim will automatically run with the needed GID as a supplemental group and so will be able to read & write to the volume. Other mounters that don't have the supplemental group (and aren't running as root) won't be able to read or write to the volume. For more information on how supplemental groups are used to manage NFS access, see the xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.adoc#nfs-supplemental-groups[Group IDs] section of NFS Volume Security.

[[provisioners-cleanup]]
== Cleanup

You can remove everything deployed by the OpenShift Ansible `openshift_provisioners` role
by performing the following steps:

----
$ ansible-playbook <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/common/openshift-cluster/openshift_provisioners.yml \
   -e openshift_provisioners_install_provisioners=False
----
