== Overview

In these examples we will walk through a few scenarios of various configuratons of xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[StorageClasses] and Dynamic Provisioning using Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine (GCE).
These examples assume some familiarity with Kubernetes, GCE and Persistent Disks and {product-title} is installed and xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[properly configured to use GCE].

[[example1]]
== Scenario 1: Basic Dynamic Provisioning with Two Types of _StorageClasses_

_StorageClasses_ can be used to differentiate and deliniate storage levels and usages, in this case the cluster-admin or storage-admin will set up two distinct classes of storage in GCE.

- slow:   cheap, efficient and optimized for sequential data operations (slower reading and writing)
- fast:   optimized for higher rates of random IOPS and sustained throughput (faster reading and writing)

By creating these _StorageClasses_, the cluster/storage-admin is allowing users to create claims requesting a particular level or service of _StorageClass_.

.StorageClass Slow Spec Definitions
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow <1>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd <2>
parameters:
  type: pd-standard <3>
  zone: us-east1-d  <4>
----
<1>  Name of the _StorageClass_.
<2>  The provisioner plug-in to be used, this is a required field for _StorageClasses_.
<3>  PD type, in this case pd-standard which has a slightly lower cost and rate of sustained IOPS and throughput vs pd-ssd which carries more sustained IOPS and throughput.
<4>  The zone is required.
====

.StorageClass Fast Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
  zone: us-east1-d
----
====

As a cluster-admin or storage-admin save both definitions to .yaml files, i.e. slow-gce.yaml and fast-gce.yaml and then create the _StorageClasses_.

====
----

# oc create -f slow-gce.yaml
storageclass "slow" created

# oc create -f fast-gce.yaml
storageclass "fast" created

# oc get storageclass
NAME       TYPE
fast       kubernetes.io/gce-pd
slow       kubernetes.io/gce-pd

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
cluster-admin or storage-admins are responsible for relaying the correct _StorageClass_ name to the correct users/groups and projects.
====


As a user, create a new project and claim the _StorageClass_.
First create the claim yaml definition, save it to a file (i.e. pvc-fast.yaml) and then execute it using _oc create_ command and finally
check to see if your claim was bound.

====
----

# oc new-project rh-eng

----

.Claim for Fast Storage Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 10Gi
----

====
----

# oc create -f pvc-fast.yaml

----

====
----

# oc get pvc
NAME              STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since this claim was created and bound in the _rh-eng_ project, it can be shared by any user in the same project.
====

As a cluster/storage-admin, view the Persistent Volume (PV) that was just dynamically provisioned.

====
----

# oc get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                     REASON    AGE
pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           Delete          Bound     rh-eng/pvc-engineering2             5m

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Notice that the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[RECLAIMPOLICY] is _Delete_ by default for all dynamic provisioned volumes, this means that the volume will only last as long as the claim still exists in the system, if the claim was deleted, the volume would also be deleted and all data would be lost.
====


Lastly, on GCE console, the new disk will be created and ready for a _Pod_ to be created referencing the persistent volume claim to start using the volume.

== Scenario 2: How to enable Default _StorageClass_ behavior for a Cluster

In this example, a cluster/storage-admin will enable a _default_ storage class to be used by all other users and projects that do not implicitly specify a _StorageClass_ annotation in their claim.  This will be useful for a cluster-admin or storage-admin that wants to provide easy management of a storage volume without having to setup or communicate specialized _StorageClasses_ across the cluster.


Building on the previous example, the cluster-admin or storage-admin will create another _StorageClass_ to be designated as the _default_ _StorageClass_.

.Default StorageClass Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: generic <1>
  annotations:
    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true" <2>
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  zone: us-east1-d
----
<1>  Name of the _StorageClass_, has no meaning other than it needs to be unique in the cluster.
<2>  Annotation that marks this _StorageClass_ as the default class.  You must use the "true" quoted in this version of the api. If annotation is not supplied, it by default implies that this is not the _default_ _StorageClass_.
====

As a cluster-admin or storage-admin save the definition to a .yaml file, (i.e. generic-gce.yaml), and then create the _StorageClasses_.

====
----

# oc create -f generic-gce.yaml
storageclass "generic" created

# oc get storageclass
NAME       TYPE
generic    kubernetes.io/gce-pd
fast       kubernetes.io/gce-pd
slow       kubernetes.io/gce-pd

----
====

As a user, create a new claim without any _StorageClass_ annotation, by creating the claim yaml definition and saving it to a file (i.e. generic-pvc.yaml), and then execute it and view if the claim was bound.

----
<1> pvc-engineering2 was bound to a dynamically provisioned Volume by _default_.

As a cluster-admin or storage-admin view the Persistent Volumes that are defined so far.

Create a manually provisioned disk using the link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[GCE] (not dynamically provisioned) and a xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[Persistent Volume] that connects to the new GCE disk.


.Manual PV Spec

Now view the PVs again, notice that a pv-manual-gce volume is Available.

----

# oc get pv

----

Now create another claim identical to the PVC above but change the name (no annotation set). Will the claim get satisfied by the _default_ _StorageClass_ or the manually available Volume?


.Claim Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-engineering3
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 15Gi

----
====


Because _default_ _StorageClass_ is enabled in this instance, the manually created PV will not satisfy the claim request, and the user would get a new dynamically provisioned Persistent Volume.

====
----

# oc get pvc
NAME               STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-engineering    Bound     pvc-e9b4fef7-8bf7-11e6-9962-42010af00004   10Gi       RWX           1h
pvc-engineering2   Bound     pvc-a9f70544-8bfd-11e6-9962-42010af00004   5Gi        RWX           19m
pvc-engineering3   Bound     pvc-6fa8e73b-8c00-11e6-9962-42010af00004   15Gi       RWX           6s

----
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the _default_ _StorageClass_ is enabled on this system, for the manually created Persistent Volume to get bound by the above claim and not have a new dynamic provisioned volume be bound, the PV would need to have been created in the _default_ _StorageClass_.
====


To fix this, the cluster/storage-admin simply needs to create another GCE disk or delete the first manual PV that was created and use a PV spec that assigns a _StorageClass_ annotation to it.

====
[source,yaml]

----
<1> The original manual PV that was created, still unbound and Available since it was not created in the _default_ _StorageClass_.
<2> The second identical PVC (other than the name) is created and now it is bound to the Available manually created PV pv-manual-gce2.
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Notice that all Dynamically Provisioned volumes by default have a RECLAIMPOLICY of _Delete_, meaning once the PVC that is dynamically bound to the PV is deleted the GCE volume is deleted and all data is lost, However, the manually created PV by default has a RECLAIMPOLICY of _Retain_.
