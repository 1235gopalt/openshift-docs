[[install-config-storage-examples-storage-classes-legacy]]
== Overview

In this example, a legacy data volume exists and a cluster/storage-admin needs to make it available for consumption and use in a particular project.  By managing with _StorageClasses_, it will decrease the likliehood of other users and projects gaining access to this volume from a claim, as the claim would have to have an exact matching value for the StorageClass annotation.  Also, this example will disable dynamic provisioning.
This example assumes some familiarity with Kubernetes, GCE and Persistent Disks and {product-title} is xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[properly configured to use GCE].



[[example1]]
=== Scenario 1: Link StorageClass to existing Persistent Volume with Legacy Data


As a cluster/storage-admin, define and create the _StorageClass_ for historical financial data.

.StorageClass finance-history Spec Definitions
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: finance-history <1>
provisioner: no-provisioning <2>
parameters: <3>

----
<1>  Name of the StorageClass.
<2>  This is a required field, but since there is to be no dynamic provisioning, a value must be put here as long as it is not an actual provisioner plug-in type.
<3>  Parameters can simply be left blank, since these are only used for the dynamic provisioner.
==== 

As a cluster-admin or storage-admin save the definitions to .yaml file, (i.e. finance-history-storageclass.yaml) and create the StorageClass.

====
----

# oc create -f finance-history-storageclass.yaml 
storageclass "finance-history" created


# oc get storageclass
NAME              TYPE
finance-history   no-provisioning           

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
cluster-admin or storage-admins are responsible for relaying the correct _StorageClass_ name to the correct users/groups and projects.
====


Now the _StorageClass_ exists, a cluster/storage-admin can create the PersistentVolume (PV) to be used with the _StorageClass_.
If an existing GCE disk does not already exist to be used, then create a manually provisioned disk using link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[GCE] (not dynamically provisioned) and a xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-gce[Persistent Volume] that connects to the new GCE disk.



.Finance History PV Spec
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
 name: pv-finance-history
 annotations:
   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: finance-history <1>
spec:
 capacity:
   storage: 35Gi
 accessModes:
   - ReadWriteMany
 gcePersistentDisk:
   readOnly: false
   pdName: the-existing-PD-volume-name-that-contains-the-valuable-data <2>
   fsType: ext4
----
<1>  The StorageClass annotation, that must match exactly.
<2>  The name of the GCE disk that already exists and contains the legacy data.
====


As a cluster/storage-admin create and view PV and notice we have a pv-finance-history Available and ready for consumption.

====
----

# oc create -f gce-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv-finance-history" created

# oc get pv
NAME                CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                        REASON    AGE
pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           Retain          Available                                          2d

----
====


As a user, create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) using the correct _StorageClass_ annotation and then view the PVC and PV to see if it is bound.

.Claim for finance-history Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
 name: pvc-finance-history
 annotations:
   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: finance-history <1>
spec:
 accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
 resources:
   requests:
     storage: 20Gi
----
<1>  The StorageClass annotation, that must match exactly or the claim will go unbound until it is deleted or another _StorageClass_ is created that matches the annotation.
====

====
----

# oc create -f pvc-finance-history.yaml 
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-finance-history" created

# oc get pvc
NAME                  STATUS    VOLUME               CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
pvc-finance-history   Bound     pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           9m


# oc get pv  (cluster/storage-admin)
NAME                 CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   RECLAIMPOLICY   STATUS      CLAIM                         REASON    AGE
pv-finance-history   35Gi       RWX           Retain          Bound       default/pvc-finance-history             5m

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important to note that _StorageClasses_ can be used in the same cluster for both legacy data (no dynamic provisioning) and with xref:../../install_config/storage_examples/storage_classes_dynamic_provisioning.adoc#install-config-storage-examples-storage-classes-dynamic-provisioning[dynamic provisioning].
