== Overview
The following use case describes how a user wanting to leverage shared storage for use by two seperate containers would configure the solution. This example highlights the use of NFS, but can easily be adapted to other shared storage types, such as GlusterFS. In addition, this example will show configuration of pod security as it relates to shared storage.
