= Configuring Red Hat Virtualization Objects

Integrating {product-title} with Red Hat Virtualization requires the
following components or services to create a highly-available and
full-featured environment.

Hypervisor Hosts and Affinity Groups::
To provide high-availability in case of the loss of one hypervisor host, Red
Hat Virtualization implements
https://ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/sla/vm-affinity/[VM
Affinity]. For the purposes of high availability across master and
infrastructure nodes, it is recommended that each class of instance is added to
a negative affinity group.

VM Instances::
A successful {product-title} environment requires instances with a minimum hardware
configuration.

xref:../install/prerequisites.html#hardware[Minimum Hardware Requirements]

It is suggested to create templates for virtual machines with the following resources:

Master and Infrastructure nodes:

* 2 CPU Cores
* 16 GiB Memory
* 10+ GiB root disk
* 15+ GiB Docker disk
* 30 GiB local volume disk
* 25+ GiB etcd (Master) or Gluster Registry (Infrastructure) disk

Application nodes:

* 2 CPU Cores
* 8 GiB Memory
* 10+ GiB root disk
* 15+ GiB Docker disk
* 30 GiB local volume disk

Load Balancer node:

* 1 CPU Core
* 4 GiB Memory
* 10+ GiB root disk
