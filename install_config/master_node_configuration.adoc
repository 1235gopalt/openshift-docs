== Overview
The `openshift start` command is used to launch OpenShift servers. The command
and its subcommands (`master` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#master[master
server] and `node` to launch a
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#node[node
server]) all take a limited set of arguments that are sufficient for launching
servers in a development or experimental environment.

However, these arguments are insufficient to describe and control the full set
of configuration and security options that are necessary in a production
environment. To provide those options, it is necessary to use the dedicated
master and node configuration files.

xref:master-configuration-files[Master configuration files] and
xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration files] are fully specified
with no default values. Therefore, any empty value indicates that you want to
start up with an empty value for that parameter. This makes it easy to reason
about exactly what your configuration is, but it also makes it difficult to
remember all of the options to specify. To make this easier, the configuration
files can be created with the `--write-config` option and then used with the
`--config` option.

[[master-configuration-files]]
== Master Configuration Files
This section reviews parameters mentioned in the *_master-config.yaml_* file.

You can xref:creating-new-configuration-files[create a new master configuration
file] to see the valid options for your installed version of {product-title}.

[[master-config-admission-control-config]]
=== Admission Control Configuration

.Admission Control Configuration Parameters
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Parameter Name | Description

|`*AdmissionConfig*`
|Contains admission control plug-in configuration.

|`*APIServerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube API server that match
the API servers' command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

|`*ControllerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube controller manager
that match the controller manager's command line arguments. These are not
migrated, but if you reference a value that does not exist the server will not
start. These values may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`,
which may cause invalid configurations.

|`*DefaultAdmissionConfig*`
|Used to enable or disable various admission plug-ins. When this type is present
as the *configuration* object under `*pluginConfig*` and if the admission
plug-in supports it, this will cause an *off by default* admission plug-in to be
enabled.

|`*PluginConfig*`
|Allows specifying a configuration file per admission control plug-in.

|`*PluginOrderOverride*`
|A list of admission control plug-in names that will be installed on the master.
Order is significant. If empty, a default list of plug-ins is used.

|`*SchedulerArguments*`
|Key-value pairs that will be passed directly to the Kube scheduler that match
the scheduler's command line arguments. These are not migrated, but if you
reference a value that does not exist the server will not start. These values
may override other settings in `*KubernetesMasterConfig*`, which may cause
invalid configurations.

[[creating-new-configuration-files]]
== Creating New Configuration Files
For masters, the `openshift start` command accepts options that indicate that it
should simply write the configuration files that it would have used, then
terminate. For nodes, a configuration file can be written using the `oadm
create-node-config` command. Creating new configuration files is useful to get a
starting point for defining your configuration.

The following commands write the relevant launch configuration file(s),
certificate files, and any other necessary files to the specified
`--write-config` or `--node-dir` directory.

To create configuration files for an all-in-one server (a master and a node on
the same host) in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --write-config=/openshift.local.config
----

To create a xref:master-configuration-files[master configuration file] and
other required files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --write-config=/openshift.local.config/master
----

To create a xref:node-configuration-files[node configuration file] and other
related files in the specified directory:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oadm create-node-config --node-dir=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname> --node=<node_hostname> --hostnames=<hostname>,<ip_address>
----

For the `--hostnames` option in the above command, use a comma-delimited list of
every host name or IP address you want server certificates to be valid for. The
above command also assumes that certificate files are located in an
*_openshift.local.config/master/_* directory. If they are not, you can include
options to specify their location. Run the command with the `-h` option to see
details.


[[launching-servers-using-configuration-files]]

== Launching Servers Using Configuration Files
Once you have modified the master and/or node configuration files to your
specifications, you can use them when launching servers by specifying them as an
argument. Keep in mind that if you specify a configuration file, none of the
other command line options you pass are respected.

To launch an all-in-one server using a master configuration and a node
configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start --master-config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml --node-config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----

To launch a master server using a master configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start master --config=/openshift.local.config/master/master-config.yaml
----

To launch a node server using a node configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ openshift start node --config=/openshift.local.config/node-<node_hostname>/node-config.yaml
----
