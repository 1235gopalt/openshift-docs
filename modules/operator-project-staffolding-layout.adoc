= Operator project scaffolding layout

The `operator-sdk` CLI generates a number of packages for each Operator project.
The following table describes a basic rundown of each generated file and
directory.

|===

|File/Folders |Purpose

|`cmd/`
|Contains `manager/main.go` file, which is the main program of the Operator. This
instantiates a new manager which registers all custom resource definitions under
`pkg/apis/` and starts all controllers under `pkg/controllers/`.

|`pkg/apis/`
|Contains the directory tree that defines the APIs of the Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs). Users are expected to edit the
`pkg/apis/<group>/<version>/<kind>_types.go` files to define the API for each
resource type and import these packages in their controllers to watch for these
resource types.

|`pkg/controller`
|This `pkg` contains the controller implementations. Users are expected to edit
the `pkg/controller/<kind>/<kind>_controller.go` files to define the
controller's reconcile logic for handling a resource type of the specified
`kind`.

|`build/`
|Contains the `Dockerfile` and build scripts used to build the operator.

|`deploy/`
|Contains various YAML manifests for registering CRDs, setting up [RBAC][RBAC],
and deploying the Operator as a Deployment.

a|`Gopkg.toml` +
`Gopkg.lock`
|The link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manifests that describe the
external dependencies of this Operator.

|`vendor/`
|The golang link:https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories[vendor] folder
that contains the local copies of the external dependencies that satisfy the
imports of this project. link:https://github.com/golang/dep[Go Dep] manages the
vendor directly.
