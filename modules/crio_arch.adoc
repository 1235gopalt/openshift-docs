= Understanding CRI-O

The link:http://cri-o.io[CRI-O] container engine provides a stable, more secure, and performant
platform for running OCI (link:https://www.opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative])
compatible runtimes.
The CRI-O container engine can be used to launch containers and pods
via OCI-compliant runtimes like runc, the default OCI runtime, or
link:https://katacontainers.io/[Kata Containers].
CRI-O's purpose is to be the container engine implementing
the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) for {product-title} and Kubernetes,
replacing the Docker service.

CRI-O offers a streamlined container engine, while other container features
are implemented as a separate set of innovative, independent commands. This
approach allows container management features to develop at their own pace,
without impeding the primary goal of CRI-O, and its only supported use case,
as the container engine for Kubernetes-based installations.

CRI-O's stability comes from the fact that it is developed,
tested and released in tandem with Kubernetes major and minor releases and follows
OCI standards.  For
example, CRI-O 1.11 aligns with Kubernetes 1.11. The scope of CRI-O is tied to
the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/container-runtime-interface.md[Container Runtime Interface] (CRI).
CRI took on the task of
extracting and standardizing exactly what a Kubernetes service (kubelet) needed
from its container engine. It did this to help stabilize Kubernetes container
engine
requirements as multiple container engines began to be developed.

There is little need for direct command-line contact with CRI-O.
However, to provide full access to CRI-O for testing and monitoring, and
to provide features you expect with Docker that CRI-O does not offer,
a new set of container-related tools were created. These tools replace and
extend what is available with the `docker` command and service. Tools
include:

* `crictl` - For troubleshooting and working directly with CRI-O container
engines
* `runc` - For running container images
* `podman` - For managing pods and container images (run, stop, start, ps,
attach, exec, etc.) outside of the container engine
* `buildah` - For building, pushing and signing container images
* `skopeo` - For copying, inspecting, deleting, and signing images

Some Docker features that are not needed in a container engine have been
left out of CRI-O, but offered in these other tools. For example, `podman` offers
exact command-line compatibility with many `docker` command features, while
extending those features to managing pods as well. No container engine is
needed to run containers or pods with `podman`.

Features for building, pushing, and signing container images, which are also
not required in a container engine, are available in the `buildah` command.
For more information about these command alternatives to `docker`, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html-single/managing_containers/finding_running_and_building_containers_without_docker#finding_running_and_building_containers_without_docker[Finding, Running and Building Containers without Docker].

This guide is here to help you install, configure, manage, use, and
troubleshoot the CRI-O engine in {product-title}.
