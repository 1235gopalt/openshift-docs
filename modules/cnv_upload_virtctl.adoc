=== Uploading a local disk image to a new PVC

You can use *virtctl image-upload* to upload a virtual machine disk image from 
a client machine to your {product-title} cluster. This creates a PVC that can be 
associated with a virtual machine after the upload has completed.

.Prerequisites

* A virtual machine disk image, in RAW or QCOW2 format. It can be compressed 
using *xz* or *gzip*.
* *kubevirt-virtctl* must be installed on the client machine.

.Procedure

. Identify the following items:
* File location of the VM disk image you want to upload
* Name and size desired for the resulting PVC
 
. Expose the *cdi-uploadproxy* service so that you can upload data to your cluster:
+
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: cdi-uploadproxy
  namespace: kube-system 
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: cdi-uploadproxy 
  tls:
    termination: passthrough
EOF
----

. Use the `virtctl image-upload` command to upload your VM image, 
making sure to include your chosen parameters. For example:
+
----
$ virtctl image-upload --uploadproxy-url=https://$(oc get route cdi-uploadproxy -o=jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}') --pvc-name=upload-fedora-pvc --pvc-size=10Gi --image-path=/images/fedora28.qcow2
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To allow insecure server connections when using HTTPS, use the `--insecure` 
parameter.
====

. To verify that the PVC was created, view all PVC objects:
+
----
$ oc get pvc
----

Next, you can xref:cnv_creating_vm.adoc#createvm[create a virtual machine] object to
bind to the PVC.
