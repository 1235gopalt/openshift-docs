== Overview

{product-title} supports many different authentication methods, as defined in
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configuring Authentication].
For now, this topic focuses on GitHub as a source of authentication, but more
providers will be added in a future release.

[[github-auth]]
== GitHub Authentication

GitHub uses OAuth, and you can integrate your {product-title} cluster to use
that OAuth authentication. OAuth basically facilitates a token exchange flow.

Configuring GitHub authentication allows users to log in to {product-title} with
their GitHub credentials. To prevent anyone with any GitHub user ID from logging
in to your {product-title} cluster, you can restrict access to only those in
specific GitHub organizations.

[[register-app-on-github]]
=== Registering the Application on GitHub

. On GitHub, click https://github.com/settings/profile[Settings] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications[OAuth applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/developers[Developer applications] ->
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register an application]
to navigate to the page for a
https://github.com/settings/applications/new[new OAuth application].
. Type an application name. For example: `My OpenShift Install`
. Type a homepage URL. For example: `https://myapiserver.com:8443`
. Optionally, type an application description.
. Type the authorization callback URL, where the end of the URL contains the
identity provider *name* (defined in the `*identityProviders*` stanza of the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#install-config-master-node-configuration[*_master configuration file_*], which you configure in the next section of this topic):
+
----
<apiserver>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>
----
+
For example:
+
----
https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/
----
. Click *Register application*. GitHub provides a Client ID and a Client Secret.
Keep this window open so you can copy these values and paste them into the
master configuration file.

[[configuring-auth-on-master]]
=== Configuring Authentication on the Master

. If you have:
.. Already completed the installation of Openshift, then copy the
*_master-config.yaml_* file into a new directory; for example:
+
----
$ mkdir githubconfig; cp master-config.yaml githubconfig
----
.. Not yet installed {product-title}, then start the {product-title} API server,
specifying the hostname of the (future) {product-title} master and a directory
to store the configuration file created by the start command:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=<apiserver> --write-config=<directory>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ openshift start master --public-master=https://myapiserver.com:8443 --write-config=githubconfig
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are installing with Ansible, then you must add the
`*identityProvider*` configuration to the Ansible playbook.
If you use the following steps to modify your configuration manually after installing with Ansible, then you will lose any modifications whenever you re-run the install tool or upgrade.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Using `openshift start master` on its own would auto-detect host names, but
GitHub must be able to redirect to the exact host name that you specified when
registering the application. For this reason, you cannot auto-detect the ID
because it might redirect to the wrong address. Instead, you must specify the
hostname that web browsers use to interact with your {product-title} cluster.
====
. Edit the new *_master-config.yaml_* file's `*identityProviders*` stanza.
. Copy
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#GitHub[the example `*GitHubIdentityProvider*` configuration]
and paste it to replace the existing stanza.
. Make the following modifications to the `*identityProviders*` stanza:
.. Change the provider `*name*` to match the callback URL you configured on
GitHub.
+
For example, if you defined the callback URL as
`https://myapiserver.com:8443/oauth2callback/github/` then the `*name*` must be
`github`.
.. Change `*clientID*` to the Client ID from GitHub that you
xref:../admin_solutions/authentication.adoc#register-app-on-github[registered previously].
.. Change `*clientSecret*` to the Client Secret from GitHub that you
xref:../admin_solutions/authentication.adoc#register-app-on-github[registered previously].
.. Change `*organizations*` to include a list of one or more GitHub
organizations to which a user must have membership in order to authenticate. If
specified, only GitHub users that are members of at least one of the listed
organizations will be allowed to log in. If this is not specified, then any
person with a valid GitHub account can log in.
. Save your changes and close the file.
. Start the {product-title} API server, specifying the configuration file you just
modified:
+
----
$ openshift start master --config=<path/to/modified/config>/master-config.yaml
----

Once configured, any user logging in to the {product-title} web console will be
prompted to log in using their GitHub credentials. On their first login, the
user must click *authorize application* to permit GitHub to use their username,
password, and organization membership with {product-title}. The user is then
redirected back to the web console.

=== Creating Users with GitHub Authentication

You do not create users in {product-title} when integrating with an external
authentication provider, such as, in this case, GitHub. GitHub is the system of
record, meaning that users are defined by GitHub, and any user belonging to a
specified organization can log in.

To add a user to {product-title}, you must add that user to an approved
organization on GitHub, and if requried create a new GitHub account for the
user.

=== Viewing Users

Once one or more users have logged in, you can run `oc get users` to view a
list of users and verify that users were created successfully:

.Output of `oc get users` command
====

----
$ oc get users
NAME         UID                                    FULL NAME   IDENTITIES
bobsmith     433b5641-066f-11e6-a6d8-acfc32c1ca87   Bob Smith   github:873654 <1>
----
<1> Identities in {product-title} are comprised of the identity provider name and GitHub's internal numeric user ID. This way, if a user changes their GitHub username or e-mail they can still log in to {product-title} instead of relying on the credentials attached to the GitHub account. This creates a stable login.
