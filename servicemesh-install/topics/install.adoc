TODO
Add an overview of Operators
////
The {ProductShortName} installation process introduces a Kubernetes operator to manage the installation of the control plane within the `istio-system` namespace.  This operator defines and monitors a custom resource related to the deployment, update, and deletion of the control plane.

[[installing-operator]]
== Installing the operator
The following steps will install the {ProductShortName} operator into an existing {product-title} 3.10 installation; they can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.  Please ensure you are logged in as a cluster admin before executing the following commands.

You can find the https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/tree/maistra-0.1.0-ocp-3.1.0-istio-1.0.0/istio[operator templates on GitHub].

```
$ oc new-project istio-operator
$ oc new-app -f istio_product_operator_template.yaml --param=OPENSHIFT_ISTIO_MASTER_PUBLIC_URL=<master public url>
```
[[verifying-operator-installation]]
== Verifying operator installation

The above instructions will create a new deployment within the `istio-operator` project, executing the operator responsible for managing the state of the {ProductName} control plane through the custom resource.

. To verify the operator is installed correctly, execute the following command:
+
```
$ oc get pods -n istio-operator
```
+
. You can access the logs from the `istio-operator` pod with the following command, replacing `<pod name>` with the name of the pod discovered above.
+
```
$ oc logs -n istio-operator <pod name>
```
+
While your exact environment may be different from the example, you should see output that looks similar to the following example:

```

[[deploying-control-plane]]
== Deploying the control plane

You use the custom resource definition file that you created to deploy the {ProductShortName} control plane.  To deploy the control plan, run the following command:
```
$ oc create -f cr.yaml -n istio-operator
```

The operator will create the `istio-system` namespace and run the installer job; this job will install and configure the control plane using Ansible playbooks.  You can follow the progress of the installation by either watching the pods or the log output from the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod.

To watch the progress of the pods execute the following command:
```
$ oc get pods -n istio-system -w
```
