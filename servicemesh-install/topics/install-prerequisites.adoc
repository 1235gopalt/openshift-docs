[[service-mesh-install_prerequisites]]
= {ProductName} installation prerequisites

Before you can install {ProductName}, you should complete the following prerequisites:

* Possess an active OpenShift Container Platform subscription on your Red Hat account. If you do not have a subscription, contact your sales representative for more information.
* Installed OpenShift Container Platform version 3.10 or higher.   For more information about the system and environment requirements, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.10/html/installing_clusters/install-config-install-prerequisites#system-requirements[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
* Installed the version of the OpenShift Container Platform command line utility (the `oc` client tool) that matches your {product-title} version (for example if you have {product-title} 3.10 you must have the matching `oc` client version 3.10), and added it to your path.  For installation instructions, see the OpenShift Container Platform https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.10/html-single/cli_reference/#installing-the-cli[Command Line Reference] document.

[[creating-custom-resource]]
= Creating a custom resource file

In order to deploy the {ProductShortName} control plane, you need to deploy a custom resource.  A _custom resource_ is an object that extends the Kubernetes API or allows you to introduce your own API into a project or a cluster.  You define a custom resource as a yaml file that defines the object. Then you use the yaml file to create the object. The complete example below contains all of the supported parameters and will deploy {ProductName} {ProductVersion} images based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

[TIP]
====
Deploying an istio-installation file that includes all of the parameters ensures that you have installed all of the Istio components required to complete the tutorials included in this document.
====

.Full example istio-installation.yaml
```
apiVersion: "istio.openshift.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Installation"
metadata:
  name: "istio-installation"
spec:
  deployment_type: openshift
  istio:
    authentication: true
    community: false
    prefix: openshift-istio-tech-preview/
    version: 0.1.0
  jaeger:
    prefix: distributed-tracing-tech-preview/
    version: 1.6.0
    elasticsearch_memory: 1Gi
  launcher:
    openshift:
      user: user
      password: password
    github:
      username: username
      token: token
    catalog:
      filter: filter
      branch: branch
      repo: repo
```

The following is the minimum required to install the control plane.  This minimal example custom resource will deploy the CentOS-based community Istio images.

.Minimum example istio-installation.yaml
```
apiVersion: "istio.openshift.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Installation"
metadata:
  name: "istio-installation"
spec:
  jaeger:
    elasticsearch_memory: 1Gi
```

[NOTE]
====
The custom resource *must* be called `istio-installation`, that is, the metadata value for `name` must be `istio-installation`.

[[creating-operator-namespace]]
== Creating the operator namespace



. Create the `istio-operator` namespace with the following command:
+
```
$ oc new-project istio-operator
```
+
[NOTE]
====
The custom resource *must* be deployed into the `istio-operator` namespace.
====
+
. Verify the namespace was created:
+
```
$ oc get projects
```

[[preparing-openshift-installation]]
= Preparing the {product-title} 3.10 installation

Before you can install the {ProductShortName} into an {product-title} 3.10 installation you must modify the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes. These changes enable features required within the {ProductShortName} and also ensure Elasticsearch will function correctly.

[[updating-master-configuration]]
== Updating the master configuration

[NOTE]
====
The community version of Istio will inject the sidecar by default if you have labeled the namespace.  You are not required to label the namespace with {ProductName}. However, {ProductName} requires you to opt-in to having the sidecar automatically injected to a deployment.  This is to avoid injecting a sidecar where it is not wanted (for example build or deploy pods).
====

To enable the automatic injection of the {ProductShortName} sidecar you first need to modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).

Make the following changes on each master within your {product-title} 3.10 installation:

. Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (for example, /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml).
. Create a file named `master-config.patch` with the following contents:
+
```
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: v1
        disable: false
        kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
```
+
. Within the same directory issue the following commands to apply the patch to the `master-config.yaml` file:
+
```
$ cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
$ oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
$ master-restart api
$ master-restart controllers
```
+
. Then you must modify each individual deployment that you want to monitor as part of your service mesh to enable automatic sidecar injection. Each deployment where you want to enable automatic injection needs to contain the `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true":` annotation.
+
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ignored
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
```

[[updating-node-configuration]]
== Updating the node configuration

In order to run the Elasticsearch application you must make a change to the kernel configuration on each node.  This change will be handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your {product-title} 3.10 installation:

. Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:
+
`vm.max_map_count = 262144`
+
. Execute the following command:
+
```
$ sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```
