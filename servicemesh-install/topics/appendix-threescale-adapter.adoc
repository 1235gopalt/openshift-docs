3scale Istio Adapter
The 3scale Istio Adapter allows you to label a service running within the {ProductName} and integrate that service with the 3Scale API Management solution.

Prerequisites:

* {ProductName} 0.7.0+
* A working 3scale account (https://www.3scale.net/signup/[SaaS] or https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.4/html/infrastructure/onpremises-installation[On-Premises])
* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#service-mesh-install_prerequisites[{ProductName} prerequisistes]

[NOTE]
====
To configure the 3scale Istio Adapter, refer to https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#install_chapter_3[Installing Service Mesh] for instructions on adding adapter parameters to the custom resource file.
====

== Integrate the adapter with {ProductName}
You can use these samples to configure request to your services using the 3scale Istio Adapter.

[NOTE]
====
Pay particular attention to the `kind: handler` resource. You must update this with your 3scale credentials and the service ID of the API you want to manage.
====

Modify the handler configuration with your 3scale configuration.

.Handler for the threescale adapter
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: handler
metadata:
  name: threescale
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  adapter: threescale
  params:
    service_id: "123456"
    system_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8090"
    access_token: "secret-token"
  connection:
    address: "threescale-istio-adapter:3333"
----

.Instance for template authorization
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: instance
metadata:
  name: threescale-authorization
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  template: threescale-authorization
  params:
    action:
      path: request.path | "/"
      method: request.method | "get"

.Rule to dispatch to threescale handler
----
apiVersion: "config.istio.io/v1alpha2"
kind: rule
metadata:
  name: threescale
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  match: destination.labels["service-mesh.3scale.net"] == "true"
  actions:
  - handler: threescale.handler.istio-system
    instances:
    - threescale-authorization

=== Routing service traffic through the adapter
In order to drive traffic for your service through the adapter and be managed by 3scale, need to match the rule `destination.labels["service-mesh.3scale.net"] == "true"` that you previously created in the configuration, in the kind: rule resource.

You must add a label to the PodTemplateSpec on the Deployment of the target workload. For example, in a `productpage` service, whose Pod is managed by the `productpage-v1` deployment, add the above label under `spec.template.labels` in `productpage-v1` to have the adapter authorize requests to this service.


= Configure the integration settings in 3scale
[NOTE]
====
For 3scale SaaS customers, {ProductName} is enabled as part of the Early Access program.
====

== Enabling service mesh for on-premises customers
. Execute the following commands to enable service mesh in 3scale.
+
```
$ oc project <3scale-project>
$ oc edit configmap system
```
+
. Edit the `rolling_updates.yml` file to add the correct value for `service_mesh_integration`.
+
.rolling_updates.yml

```

== Integration settings
. Navigate to *[your_API_name] > Integration > Configuration*.
. A the top of the *Integration* page click on *edit integration settings* in the top right corner.
. Under the *Service Mesh* heading, click the *Istio* option.
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Update Service*.

= Caching behavior
Responses from 3scale System API's will be cached by default within the adapter. Entries will be purged from the cache when they become older than the `cacheTTLSeconds` value. Also by default, automatic refreshing of cached entries will be attempted seconds before they expire, based on the `cacheRefreshSeconds` value. Automatic refreshing can be disabled by setting this value higher than the `cacheTTLSeconds` value.

Caching can be disabled entirely by setting `cacheEntriesMax` to a non-positive value.

Through the refreshing process, cached values whose hosts become unreachable will be retried before eventually being purged when past their expiry.

= Authenticating requests
For this Technology Preview release, the only supported authentication mechanism will be providing credentials as a query parameter using the API key method. The key should use the default “user_key” query value.

See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.4/html/api_authentication/authentication-patterns#authentication_patterns[authentication patterns] for more information.

= Adapter metrics
The adapter, by default reports various Prometheus metrics which are exposed on port `8080` at the `/metrics` endpoint. These allow some insight into how the interactions between the adapter and 3scale are performing. The service is labelled to be automatically discovered and scraped by Prometheus.
