Need a short overview of Prometheus.

Prerequisites:

* OpenShift Container Catalog 3.10 or higher installed.
* {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installed.
* `Bookinfo` demonstration application installed.

== Querying metrics

. Verify that the `prometheus` service is running in your cluster. In Kubernetes environments, execute the following command:
+
```
$ oc get svc prometheus -n istio-system
```
+
You should see something like the following:
+
```
NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
prometheus   10.59.241.54   <none>        9090/TCP   2m
```
+
. Generate network traffic by accessing the Bookinfo application:
+
```
$ curl -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```
+
. A route to access the Prometheus user interface should already exist. Query OpenShift for details of the route:
+
```
  $ export PROMETHEUS_URL=$(oc get route -n istio-system prometheus -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```
+
. Launch a browser and navigate to  `http://${PROMETHEUS_URL}`, you should see the Prometheus home screen, similar to this:
+
image::prometheus-home-screen.png[]
+
. In the "Expression" field enter `istio_request_duration_seconds_count`, and click the `Execute` button. You should see a screen similar to this:
+
image::prometheus-metrics.png[]
+
. You can narrow down queries by using selectors. For example `istio_request_duration_seconds_count{destination_workload="reviews-v2"}` will only show counters with matching "destination_workload" label. For more information about using queries, see the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#instant-vector-selectors[Prometheus documentation].
+
. To list all available Prometheus metrics, use the following command:
+
```
  $ oc get prometheus -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.metrics[*].name}'
  requests_total request_duration_seconds request_bytes response_bytes tcp_sent_bytes_total tcp_received_bytes_total
```
Note that returned metric names need to be prepended with `istio_` when used in queries, for example,  `requests_total` will become `istio_requests_total`.

== Removing the Prometheus tutorial

The procedure for removing the Prometheus tutorial is the same as removing the Bookinfo tutorial.
