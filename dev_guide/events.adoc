== Overview

OpenShift events are modeled based on events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift cluster.  Events allow OpenShift to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner. They also allow developers and administrators to consume information about system components in a unified way.

== Querying events with the CLI

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available

== Viewing events in the console

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available

== Out-of-band interface

// NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

OpenShift administrators can consume events directly via an out-of-band interface instead
of querying the API server. This can be helpful, for example, if the API server cannot be contacted by a system component in order to record events.

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available
