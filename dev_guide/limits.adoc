== Overview

A `*LimitRange*` object enumerates
link:compute_resources.html[compute resource constraints] in a
link:projects.html[project]. This allows you to specify the amount of resources
that a pod or container can consume.

== Constraints

A `*LimitRange*` object enumerates compute resource constraints at a pod and
container scope in a project.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each
`*LimitRange*` object in the project.  If the resource violates any of the
enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected.  If the resource does
not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then
the default value is applied to the resource.

=== Container Limits

*Supported Resources:*

1. CPU
2. Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

.Container
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] <= container.resources.requests[resource] (required) <= container/resources.limits[resource] (optional)

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) <= Max[resource]

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] <= ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

|===

*Supported Defaults:*

1. Default[resource] - defaults container.resources.limit[resource] to specified value if none
2. Default Requests[resource] - defaults container.resources.requests[resource] to specified value if none

=== Pod limits

*Supported Resources:*

1. CPU
2. Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`*Min*`
|Min[resource] less than or equal to container.resources.requests[resource] (required) less than or equal to container.resources.limits[resource] (optional)

|`*Max*`
|container.resources.limits[resource] (required) less than or equal to Max[resource]

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource] less than or equal to ( container.resources.limits[resource] / container.resources.requests[resource])

== Creating a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a link:#limit-range-def[limit range
object definition] on your file system to your specifications, then run:

----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file>
----

== Viewing Limits

To view limits enforced in a project:

====
----
$ oc get limits
NAME
limits

$ oc describe limits limits
Name:        limits
Namespace:   default
Type         Resource  Min Max Request Limit Limit/Request
----         --------  --- --- ------- ----- -------------
Pod          memory    6Mi 1Gi -       -     -
Pod          cpu       200m  2 -       -     -
Container    cpu       100m  2 200m    300m  10
Container    memory    4Mi 1Gi 100Mi   200Mi -

== Deleting Limits

If you do not want to enforce limits in a project, you can remove any active
limit range by name:

----
$ oc delete limits <limit_name>
