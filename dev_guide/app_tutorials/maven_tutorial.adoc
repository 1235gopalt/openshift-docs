[[nexus-introduction]]
== Introduction

While developing your application with Java and Maven, you will most likely be
building many times. In order to shorten the build times of your pods, Maven
dependencies can be cached in a local Nexus repository. This tutorial will
guide you through creating a Nexus repository on your cluster.

This tutorial assumes that you are working with a project that is already set
up for use with Maven. If you are interested in using Maven with your Java
project, it is highly recommended that you look at
link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html[their guide].

In addition, be sure to check your application's image for Maven mirror
capabilities. Many images that use Maven have a `*MAVEN_MIRROR_URL*` environment
variable that you can use to simplify this process. If it does not have this
capability, read
link:https://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/config.html[the Nexus documentation]
to configure your build properly.

[[nexus-setting-up-nexus]]
== Setting up Nexus

Use `new-app` to download and deploy the official Nexus Docker image.

----
oc new-app sonatype/nexus
----

After the build has finished, run:

----
oc get svc
----

The output should resemble:

----
NAME      CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
nexus     172.30.170.249   <none>        8081/TCP   6s
----

Confirm that Nexus is running by navigating your browser to the new Cluster-IP
at port 8081. The server may take a bit of time to start, be patient!

Nexus comes pre-configured for the Central Repository, but you may need others
for your application.  For many Red Hat images, it is recommended to add the
*jboss-ga* repository at *_https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/_*.
link:https://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/config-maven.html[Learn how to add repositories].
The default administrator username is *admin*, and the password is *admin123*.

[[nexus-adding-probes-to-check-for-success]]
=== Using Probes to Check for Success

This is a good time to set up readiness and liveness probes. These will
periodically check to see that Nexus is running properly.
xref:../application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[Learn more about probes].

----
$ oc set probe dc/nexus \
	--liveness \
	--failure-threshold 3 \
	--initial-delay-seconds 30 \
	-- echo ok
$ oc set probe dc/nexus \
	--readiness \
	--failure-threshold 3 \
	--initial-delay-seconds 30 \
	--get-url=http://nexus:8081/content/groups/public

[[nexus-adding-persistence-to-nexus]]
=== Adding Persistence to Nexus

[NOTE]
====
If you do not want persistent storage, continue to
xref:nexus-connecting-to-nexus[Connecting to Nexus]. However, your cached
dependencies will be lost if the pod is restarted for any reason.
====

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) for Nexus, so that your dependencies
will not be lost when the pod running the server terminates. If you do not have
administrator access on your cluster, ask your system administrator to create a
Read/Write Persistent Volume for you.  Otherwise, read
xref:../volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[Managing Volumes in {product-title}] for instructions on
creating a persistent volume.

Add a PVC to the Nexus deployment configuration.

----
$ oc volumes dc/nexus --remove --confirm
$ oc volumes dc/nexus --add \
	--name 'nexus-pvc' \
	--type 'pvc' \
	--mount-path '/sonatype-work/' \
	--claim-name 'nexus-pv' \
	--claim-size '1G'
----

This removes the previous ephemeral volume for the deployment config and adds a
claim for 1 gigabyte of persistent storage mounted at `/sonatype-work`, which
is where our dependencies will be stored. Due to the change in configuration,
the Nexus pod will be redeployed automatically.

Verify that Nexus is running by refreshing the Nexus page in your browser. You
can monitor the deployment's progress using:

----
$ oc get pods -w
----

[[nexus-connecting-to-nexus]]
== Connecting to Nexus

The next steps demonstrate defining a build that will use the new Nexus
repository.  The rest of the tutorial will be using
link:https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git[this example repository]
with *wildfly-100-centos7* as a builder, but these changes should work for any
project.

The example builder image, *wildfly-100-centos7* supports `*MAVEN_MIRROR_URL*` as
part of its environment, so we can use this to point our builder image to our
Nexus repository. If your image does not support consuming an environment
variable to configure a Maven mirror, you may need to modify the builder image
to provide the correct Maven settings to point to the Nexus mirror.

----
$ oc new-build openshift/wildfly-100-centos7:latest~https://github.com/openshift/jee-ex.git \
	-e MAVEN_MIRROR_URL='http://nexus.<Nexus_Project>:8081/content/groups/public/'
$ oc logs build/jee-ex-1 --follow
----

Replace `<Nexus_Project>` with the project name of the Nexus repository.  If it
is in the same project as the application that is using it, you can remove the
`<Nexus_Project>.`.

[[nexus-confirming-success]]
== Confirming Success

In your web browser, navigate to
*_http://<Nexus IP>:8081/content/groups/public_* to confirm that it has stored
your application's dependencies. You can also check the build logs to see if
Maven is using the Nexus mirror. If successful, you should see output
referencing the URL *_http://nexus:8081_*.
