== Overview

The BuildDefaults admission control plugin allows an administrator to set global defaults for settings such as the git
HTTP and HTTPS proxy, and default environment variables. These defaults will not overwrite values that have been configured
for a particular build. However, if they are not present on the build definition, they will be set as the default value.

The BuildOverrides admission control plugin allows overriding a setting in a build, regardless of the value stored in the
build. It currently supports overriding the ForcePull flag on a build strategy to enforce always pulling down of images.
This ensures that a user can only build with an image that they are allowed to pull.

=== Setting Build Defaults

To configure the BuildDefaults plugin, add a configuration for it in the master-config.yaml file:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      BuildDefaults:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: BuildDefaultsConfig
          gitHTTPProxy: http://my.proxy:8080 <1>
          gitHTTPSproxy: https://my.proxy:8443 <2>
          env:
          - name: HTTP_PROXY <3>
            value: http://my.proxy:8080
          - name: HTTPS_PROXY <4>
            value: https://my.proxy:8443
          - name: CUSTOM_VAR <5>
            value: custom_value
----

<1> Sets the HTTP proxy to use when cloning source code from git repository
<2> Sets the HTTPS proxy to use when cloning source code from git repository
<3> Default environment variable that sets the HTTP proxy to use during the build. This may be used for
downloading depencies during the assemble/build phase.
<4> Default environment variable that sets the HTTPS proxy to use during the build. This may be used for
downloading depencies during the assemble/build phase.
<5> Additional default environment variable that will be added to every build.

=== Setting Build Overrides

To configure the BuildOverrides plugin, add a configuration for it in the master-config.yaml file:

====

[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginConfig:
      BuildOverrides:
        configuration:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: BuildOverridesConfig
          forcePull: true <1>
----

<1> Force all builds to pull their builder image and any source images before starting the build.
