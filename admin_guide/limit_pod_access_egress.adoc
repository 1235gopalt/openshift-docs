== Overview

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can use egress policy to limit
the addresses that some or all pods can access from within the cluster, so that:

- A pod can only talk to internal hosts, and cannot initiate connections to the
public Internet.
+
Or, 
- A pod can only talk to the public Internet, and cannot initiate connections to
internal hosts (outside the cluster).
+
Or,
- A pod cannot reach specified internal subnets/hosts that it should have no
reason to contact.

For example, you can configure projects with different egress policies, allowing
`<project A>` access to a specified IP range, but denying the same access to
`<project B>`. 

[CAUTION]
====
You must have the 
xref:../install_config/configuring_sdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-sdn[*ovs-multitenant* plug-in] enabled in order to limit pod access via egress policy.
====

Project administrators can neither create `*EgressNetworkPolicy*` objects, nor
edit the ones you create in their project. 

The `default` project (and any other global namespace) cannot have egress
policy. 

[NOTE]
====
If you merge two projects together (via `oadm pod-network join-projects`), 
then you cannot use egress policy in _any_ of the joined projects.

If you make a project global (via `oadm pod-network make-projects-global`), 
then it cannot have an `*EgressNetworkPolicy*`. 

If an allowed network overlaps with a denied network, then the rules are 
checked in order, and the first one that matches is enforced.

== Configuring Pod Access Limits


To configure pod access limits, you must use the `oc` command or the REST API.
You can use `oc [create|replace|delete]` to manipulate `*EgressNetworkPolicy*`
objects. The *_api/swagger-spec/oapi-v1.json_* file has API-level details on how
the objects actually work. 

To configure pod access limits:

. Navigate to the project you want to affect. 
. Create a JSON file for the pod limit policy:
+
----
# oc create -f <policy>.json
----
. Configure the JSON file with policy details. For example:
+
----
{
    "kind": "EgressNetworkPolicy",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "default"
    },
    "spec": {
        "egress": [
            {
                "type": "Allow",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "1.2.3.0/24"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Deny",
                "to": {
                    "cidrSelector": "0.0.0.0/32"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
When the example above is added in a project, it allows traffic to `1.2.3.0/24`,
but denies access to all other external IP addresses. This would not affect
traffic to other pods.
