== Overview
OpenShift relies on run-once pods to perform tasks such as link:../dev_guide/deployments.html[deploying a pod] or
link:../dev_guide/builds.html[performing a build]. Run-once pods are pods that have a RestartPolicy of `Never` or `OnFailure`.

The cluster administrator can use the `RunOnceDuration` admission control plug-in to force a limit on the time that those
run-once pods can be active. Once the time limit expires, the cluster will try to actively terminate those pods.
The main reason to have such a limit is to prevent tasks such as builds to run for an excessive amount of time.

== Configuring the RunOnceDuration plug-in

Because the `RunOnceDuration` plug-in is not enabled by default, it must be specified along with default Kubernetes admission
control plug-ins in the master-config.yaml configuration file.

The plugin configuration can also include the default active deadline for run-once pods. This deadline will be enforced globally
but can be superseded on per-project basis.

====

[source,yaml]

kubernetesMasterConfig:
  admissionConfig:
    pluginOrderOverride:
    - RunOnceDuration <1>
    - NamespaceLifecycle
    - OriginPodNodeEnvironment

----

<1> Add the plugin to the list of admission control plugins.
<2> Specify the global default for run-once pods in seconds.

== Specifying a custom duration per Project

In addition to specifying a global maximum duration for run-once pods, an administrator can add an annotation (`openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override`)
to a specific project to override the global default.

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/active-deadline-seconds-override: "1000" <1>
----

<1> Overrides the default active deadline seconds for run-once pods to 1000 seconds.
Note that the value of the override must be specified in string form.
