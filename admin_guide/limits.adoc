== Overview

// tag::admin_limits_overview[]
A limit range, defined by a `*LimitRange*` object, enumerates
link:../dev_guide/compute_resources.html#dev-compute-resources[compute resource
constraints] in a link:../dev_guide/projects.html[project] at the pod and
container level, and specifies the amount of resources that a pod or container
can consume.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each
`*LimitRange*` object in the project. If the resource violates any of the
enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected. If the resource does not
set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the
default value is applied to the resource.

[[container-limits]]
=== Container Limits

// tag::admin_limits_container_limits[]
*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Per container, the following must hold true if specified:

.Container
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Behavior

|`*Min*`
|`Min[resource]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[resource]`
(required) less than or equal to `container/resources.limits[resource]`
(optional)

If the configuration defines a `min` CPU, then the request value must be greater
than the CPU value. A limit value does not need to be specified.

|`*Max*`
|`container.resources.limits[resource]` (required) less than or equal to
`Max[resource]`

If the configuration defines a `max` CPU, then you do not need to define a
request value, but a limit value does need to be set that satisfies the maximum
CPU constraint.

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource]` less than or equal to (
`container.resources.limits[resource]` /
`container.resources.requests[resource]`)

If a configuration defines a `maxLimitRequestRatio` value, then any new
containers must have both a request and limit value. Additionally,
{product-title} calculates a limit to request ratio by dividing the limit by the
request.

For example, if a container has `cpu: 500` in the `limit` value, and
`cpu: 100` in the `request` value, then its limit to request ratio for `cpu` is
`5`. This ratio must be less than or equal to the `maxLimitRequestRatio`.
|===

*Supported Defaults:*

`Default[resource]`:: Defaults `container.resources.limit[resource]` to specified value if none.
`Default Requests[resource]`:: Defaults `container.resources.requests[resource]` to specified value if none.
// end::admin_limits_container_limits[]

[[pod-limits]]
=== Pod Limits

// tag::admin_limits_pod_limits[]
*Supported Resources:*

* CPU
* Memory

*Supported Constraints:*

Across all containers in a pod, the following must hold true:

.Pod
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Constraint |Enforced Behavior

|`*Min*`
|`Min[resource]` less than or equal to `container.resources.requests[resource]`
(required) less than or equal to `container.resources.limits[resource]`
(optional)

|`*Max*`
|`container.resources.limits[resource]` (required) less than or equal to
`Max[resource]`

|`*MaxLimitRequestRatio*`
|`MaxLimitRequestRatio[resource]` less than or equal to (
`container.resources.limits[resource]` /
`container.resources.requests[resource]`)

[[creating-a-limit-range]]
== Creating a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project, create a link:#limit-range-def[limit range
object definition] on your file system to your desired specifications, then run:

----
$ oc create -f <limit_range_file> -n <project>
----

[[viewing-limits]]
== Viewing Limits

// tag::admin_limits_viewing[]
You can view any limit ranges defined in a project by navigating in the web
console to the project's *Settings* tab.

You can also use the CLI to view limit range details:

. First, get the list of limit ranges defined in the project. For example, for a
project called *demoproject*:
+
====
----
$ oc get limits -n demoproject
NAME              AGE
resource-limits   6d
----
====

. Then, describe the limit range you are interested in, for example the
*resource-limits* limit range:
+
====
----
$ oc describe limits resource-limits
Name:		resource-limits
Namespace:	demoproject
Type		Resource	Min	Max	Default Request	Default Limit	Max Limit/Request Ratio
----		--------	---	---	---------------	-------------	-----------------------
Pod		cpu		30m	2	-		-		-
Pod		memory		150Mi	1Gi	-		-		-
Container	memory		150Mi	1Gi	307Mi		512Mi		-
Container	cpu		30m	2	60m		1		-

[[deleting-limits]]
== Deleting Limits

Remove any active limit range to no longer enforce the limits of a project:

----
$ oc delete limits <limit_name>
----
