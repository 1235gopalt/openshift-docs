== Overview

This topic describes how to label an existing {product-title} cluster running on
Amazon Web Services (AWS).

To correctly identify which resources are associated with a cluster, tag
resources with the key `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>`, where `<name>` is a unique
name for the cluster. Tagging all resources with the
`kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` tag avoids potential issues with multiple zones
or multiple clusters.

See
xref:../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[Configuring
AWS] for guidance on configuring AWS variables and {product-title} masters for
AWS.

See xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[Pods and
Services] to learn more about labeling and tagging in {product-title}.

== Resources That Need Tags
There are four types of resources that need to be tagged:

* Instances
* Security Groups
* Load Balancers
* EBS Volumes

== Tagging an Existing Cluster

A cluster will use the value of the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` tag to determine which
resources belong to the cluster. Therefore, you must tag all resources with the
key `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` and have the same value for that key.

. Tag all instances with `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` and a value to be used as the cluster ID.
. Tag any security groups with `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` and the same value used for the instances.
. Tag any load balancers with `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` and the same value used for the instances.
. Tag all EBS volumes with `kubernetes.io/cluster/<name>` and the same value used for the instances. The EBS Volumes that need to be tagged can found with:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pv -o json|jq '.items[].spec.awsElasticBlockStore.volumeID'
----

. Restart `atomic-openshift-master` and `atomic-openshift-node` on all nodes:
+
[source,bash]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controller atomic-openshift-node
----
